This cannot right now be expressed as inline assembly in the unwinder at all 
because there is no way to inject the push/pops into the compiler generated
ehframe tables.

[BTW I plan to resubmit the unwinder with some changes]

gcc normally doesn't generate push/pops around directly around the
call site, but somewhere else due to the way its register allocator works.
It can be anywhere in the function or even not there at all if the register
didn't contain anything useful. And they're not necessarily push/pops of 
course.

So you would need to write it as inline assembly. I'm not sure it would
be significantly cleaner than just having tables then.

It's unlikely you can do much useful in 5 bytes I guess.

Regarding cli/sti: i've been actually thinking about changing it in the
non paravirt kernel. IIRC most save_flags/restore_flags are inside
spin_lock_irqsave/restore() and that is a separate function anyways
so a little larger special case code is ok as long as it is not slower. 
There is some evidence that at least on P4 a software cli/sti flag without 
pushf/popf would be faster.
