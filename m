Please fix clang. It isn't all that hard to fix.

However, __GCC_GNU_INLINE__ means you are in GNU mode by default, on gcc's new enough to have multiple misses.

The right thing to look for is __GCC_STDC_INLINE__ in which case you need the attribute.

By the way, you should check clang against gcc's predefined macros by doing:

gcc [options] -x c -Wp,-dM -E /dev/null | sort

Options can change the predefined macros substantially, especially the, -std=, arch and -O options. -x c can be replaced with e.g. -x c++, objective-c, assembler-with-cpp etc.
