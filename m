This plan does not make me happy. Versioning is much messier than
features to support, and much harder for downstreams to
cherry-pick.

It's definitely easier for virtio-pci than for devices.
But let's address the motivation point.
Do you expect a need to have a huge structure there, like
megabytes in size, so space will be an issue again?
