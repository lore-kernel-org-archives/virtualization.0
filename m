Interesting. Since the feature in question is billed first of all a
performance optimization, I think we might need some performance numbers
as a motivation.

Since the patches affect code paths when mergeable RX buffers are
disabled as well, I guess the most important point would be to verify
whether there's increase in latency and/or CPU utilization, or bandwidth
cost when the feature bit is *disabled*.

This feature also seems to conflict with zero-copy rx patches from Xin
Xiaohui (subject: Provide a zero-copy method on KVM virtio-net) these
are not in a mergeable shape yet, so this is not a blocker, but I wonder
what your thoughts on the subject are: how will we do feature
negotiation if some backends don't support some features?

If you do, any chance you could use git send-email for this?

Pls take a look here as well
