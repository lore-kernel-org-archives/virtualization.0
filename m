I don't know for sure whether that's the case and whether we can rely on
that not happening, we'll need x86 folks opinion here.

I think we should make all virtio drivers use the DMA API and just have
different set of dma_ops. We can make a simple ifdef powerpc if needed
in virtio-pci that force the dma-ops of the device to some direct
"bypass" ops at init time.

That way no need to select whether to use the DMA API or not, just
always use it, and add a tweak to replace the DMA ops with the direct
ones on the archs/platforms that need that. That was my original
proposal and I still think it's the best approach.

I'll let you sort that out with Rusty but it makes sense.

As I said, make it always use the DMA API, but add a quirk to replace
the dma_ops with some NULL ops on platforms that need it.

The only issue with that is the location of the dma ops is arch
specific, so that one function will contain some ifdefs, but the rest of
the code can just use the DMA API.
 
Cheers,
