To elaborate a bit ....

What we are trying to solve here is entirely a guest problem, I don't
think involving qemu in the solution is the right thing to do.

The guest can only allow external parties (qemu, potentially PCI
devices, etc...) access to some restricted portions of memory (insecure
memory). Thus the guest need to do some bounce buffering/swiotlb type
tricks.

This is completely orthogonal to whether there is an actual iommu
between the guest and the device (or emulated device/virtio).

This is why I think the solution should reside in the guest kernel, by
proper manipulation (by the arch code) of the dma ops.

I don't think forcing the addition of an emulated iommu in the middle
just to work around the fact that virtio "cheats" and doesn't use the
dma API unless there is one, is the right "fix".

The right long term fix is to always use the DMA API, reducing code
path etc... and just have a single point where virtio can "chose"
alternate DMA ops (via an arch hook to deal with our case).

In the meantime, having the hook we propose gets us going, but if you
agree with the approach, we should also work on the long term approach.

Cheers,
Ben.
