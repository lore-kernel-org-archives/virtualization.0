Not sure how exactly it works, but it seems to me that an immediate
assignment to the value you're going to compare would leave very little
doubt.

Then again, maybe cores aren't that smart and only look at the
hysterical btb for prediction.

Ingo was rewriting the changelog, other than that, no, I can do this on
top. Just spotted this because Ingo and me talked it over.

More code generation still, replacing the call with an immediate
assignment to the return register is the shortest possible option I
think.
