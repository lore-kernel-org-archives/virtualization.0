Isn't that going to cause the routing table to get messed up when we
rearrange the netdevs? We don't want to have an significant disruption
 in traffic when we are adding/removing the VF. It seems like we would
need to invalidate any entries that were configured for the virtio_net
and reestablish them on the new team interface. Part of the criteria
we have been working with is that we should be able to transition from
having a VF to not or vice versa without seeing any significant
disruption in the traffic.

Also how does this handle any static configuration? I am assuming that
everything here assumes the team will be brought up as soon as it is
seen and assigned a DHCP address.

The solution as you have proposed seems problematic at best. I don't
see how the team solution works without introducing some sort of
traffic disruption to either add/remove the VF and bring up/tear down
the team interface. At that point we might as well just give up on
this piece of live migration support entirely since the disruption was
what we were trying to avoid. We might as well just hotplug out the VF
and hotplug in a virtio at the same bus device and function number and
just let udev take care of renaming it for us. The idea was supposed
to be a seamless transition between the two interfaces.
