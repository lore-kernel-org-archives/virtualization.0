Yeah ... to put some numbers on it, assume we have a 256 entry ring now.

Currently, with GSO enabled in the host the guest will fill this with 12
buffer heads with 20 buffers per head (a 10 byte buffer, an MTU sized
buffer and 18 page sized buffers).

That means we allocate ~900k for receive buffers, 12k for the ring, fail
to use 16 ring entries and the ring ends up with a capacity of 12
packets. In the case of MTU sized packets from an off-host source,
that's a huge amount of overhead for ~17k of data.

If we wanted to match the packet capacity that Herbert's suggestion
enables (i.e. 256 packets), we'd need to bump the ring size to 4k
entries (assuming we reduce it to 19 entries per packet). This would
mean we'd need to allocate ~200k for the ring and ~18M in receive
buffers. Again, assuming MTU sized packets, that's massive overhead for
~400k of data.

Also, including virtio_net_hdr in the data buffer would need another
feature flag. Rightly or wrongly, KVM's implementation requires
virtio_net_hdr to be the first buffer:

    if (elem.in_num < 1 || elem.in_sg[0].iov_len != sizeof(*hdr)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "virtio-net header not in first element\n");
        exit(1);
    }

i.e. it's part of the ABI ... at least as KVM sees it :-)

I'll give that a shot.

Cheers,
