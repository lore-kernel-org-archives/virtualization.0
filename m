I am afraid I can't help you here. It is very complicated stuff and a 
model is actually doesn't fit your assumptions about CPUs well without 
some simplifications which are based on what you want to have.

I say that SYNC_ACQUIRE/etc follows what you expect for smp_acquire etc 
(basing on that document). And at least two CPU models were tested with 
my patches (see it in LMO) for that last year and that instructions are 
implemented now in engineering kernel.

If you have something else in mind, you can ask me. But I prefer to do 
not deviate too much from Documentation/memory-barriers.txt, for exam - 
if it asks to have memory barrier somewhere, then I assume the code 
should have it, and please - don't ask me a test which violates the 
current version of document recommendations.

For a moment I don't see a significant changes in this document for MIPS 
Arch at least 1.5 year, and the only significant point is that MIPS CPU 
Arch doesn't have yet smp_read_barrier_depends() and smp_rmb() should be 
used instead.
