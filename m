Yes, but at least I'm not being intentionally obtuse.

Like I said, I'm well aware of that. The issue here isn't the
dependency, it's that it depends on something that isn't exposed
anywhere!

Think about it from the user's pov. They check what VIRTIO_BLK depends
on - just VIRTIO.

So they try to figure out how to flip on VIRTIO, or what VIRTIO even is.

See how that last step might be problematic? CONFIG_VIRTIO is not
exposed! It doesn't even seem to control anything!

Go back to your example. Checking the dependencies for E1000 would tell
you the user needs to flip on CONFIG_PCI. Done. Easy.

User checks the dependencies here and... what do _you_ expect people to
do?

Look, depending on a kconfig option that's supposed to be user
controllable but isn't exposed anywhere is flat out broken. The fact
that it's in a different submenu just makes it worse.

The problem is that VIRTIO_BLK's dependencies are not actually specified
in the kconfig. If it depends on VIRTIO_PCI, that's what the kconfig
should say. If it depends on having any of multiple virtio backends
enabled, then specify that!

depends VIRTIO_PCI || VIRTIO_WHATEVER

Or if you really want to have a fake config option that's enabled if you
have any virtio backend enabled, fix the damn comments and naming!

How is anyone supposed to know that CONFIG_VIRTIO really means "any
virtio backend?" Call it VIRTIO_ANY_BACKEND if that's what it really is.

And, if that is what you're doing with CONFIG_VIRTIO (I'm still not
sure) the comment at the top of drivers/virtio/Kconfig is _wrong_:

# Virtio always gets selected by whoever wants it.
VIRTIO
        tristate

How is _anyone_ supposed to know that really means "VIRTIO gets selected
by things that provide a virtio backend?"

C'mon, you've had to debug other people's code before. What would _you_
think if you were tripped up by something like that?

Yep, use it all the time.
