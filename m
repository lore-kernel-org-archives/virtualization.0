If you know that:

  - pci_device_shutdown() disables MSI,
  - disabling MSI changes the virtio register layout, and
  - the driver may touch the device after pci_device_shutdown(),

it seems like you might want a virtio shutdown method so you can
find out when the register layout changes.  Changing the register
layout sounds completely broken, and dealing with it sounds racy, but
it sounds like a mess that should be handled by the driver.

Well, I suppose you see the problem with adding workarounds on top of
workarounds, especially when we don't have a clear understanding of
why we need them.  The "disable MSI on shutdown" code was added here:

http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d52877c7b1af

and there is no information in that patch about it being a workaround
for devices with broken bus master enable.

The cumulative effect of stuff like this is that it becomes impossible
to do any meaningful restructuring in the core without breaking some
corner case.
