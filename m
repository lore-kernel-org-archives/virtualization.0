We're not ignoring it.  virtqueue_start_buf uses both nents and nsg:

        if (vq->indirect && (nents > nsg || vq->vq.num_free < nents)) {
		/* indirect */
	}

"More than one buffer" is not a great heuristic.  In particular, it
causes all virtio-blk and virtio-scsi requests to go indirect.

More than three buffers, or more than five buffers, is just an ad-hoc
hack, and similarly not great.

You said "in + out instead of nsg + direction", but now instead you're
talking about specifying in/out upfront in virtqueue_start_buf.

Specifying in/out in virtqueue_add_sg would have two loops instead of
one, one of them (you don't know which) unused on every call, and
wouldn't fix the problem of possibly misusing the API.

Specifying in/out upfront would look something like

	flags = vq->idx > vq->in ? VRING_DESC_F_WRITE : 0;

or with some optimization

	flags = vq->something > 0 ? VRING_DESC_F_WRITE : 0;

It is not clear for me whether you'd allow a single virtqueue_add_sg to
cover both out and in elements.  If so, the function would become much
more complex because the flags could change in the middle, and that's
what I was referring to.  If not, you traded one possible misuse with
another.

Perhaps, but 3 or 4 arguments (in/out/nsg or in/out/nsg_in/nsg_out) just
for this are definitely too many and make the API harder to use.

You have to find a balance.  Having actually used the API, the
possibility of mixing in/out buffers by mistake never even occurred to
me, much less happened in practice, so I didn't consider it a problem.
Mixing in/out buffers in a single call wasn't a necessity, either.
