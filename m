Quote from Virtio-spec:

| 2.4.3 Dealing With Configuration Changes
| Some virtio PCI devices can change the device configuration state, as reflected
| in the virtio header in the PCI configuration space. In this case:
| 
| 1. If MSI-X capability is disabled: an interrupt is delivered and the sec-
| ond highest bit is set in the ISR Status field to indicate that the driver
| should re-examine the configuration space.

| Note that a single interrupt can
| indicate both that one or more virtqueue has been used and that the con-
| figuration space has changed: even if the config bit is set, virtqueues must
| be scanned. <<<<

It seems current code is fine.
