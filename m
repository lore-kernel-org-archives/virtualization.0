Well, we'd patch the inline over the call if we have room.

Magic patching would be neat, but the downsides are that (1) we can't
expand the patching room and (2) there's no way of attaching clobber
info to the call site (doing register liveness analysis is not
appealing).

Now, this may not be fatal.  5 bytes is enough for all the native ops to
be patched inline.   For lguest this covers popf and pushf, but not cli
and sti (10 bytes): they'd have to be calls.

As for clobber info, it turns out that almost all of the calls can
clobber %eax, which is probably enough.  We just need to mark the
handful of asm ones where this isn't true.

Thoughts?
Rusty.
