Wait, what do you mean by "native drivers"?

Isn't the hv_vmbus drivers the "native drivers" happening here?

Or are you referring to the "emulated-slow-as-hell drivers" that are
used to boot the machine?

I agree with the first part, but no modprobe should ever need to be
done, the hotplug boot process should properly load those modules when
the vmbus devices are seen by the vmbus core and the hotplug events
generated, which in turn calls modprobe, right?

So there should not need to be any special module.conf file changes for
hv systems, with the exception that the "emulated" drivers should be
added to the blacklist.

I agree :)

They are?  Ick, why can't the vmbus storage driver see a cdrom device?
It's just a scsi device, right?
