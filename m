Yep, I was thinking of adding KERN_WARN's in vmi_init, though I like
your suggestion better. Also added SOB line. Thanks.

Mark VMI for removal in feature-removal-schedule.txt.

From: Alok N Kataria <akataria@vmware.com>

Add text in feature-removal.txt and also modify Kconfig to disable
vmi by default.

+What:	Support for VMware's guest paravirtuliazation technique [VMI] will be
+	dropped.
+When:	2.6.37 or earlier.
+Why:	With the recent innovations in CPU hardware acceleration technologies
+	from Intel and AMD, VMware ran a few experiments to compare these
+	techniques to guest paravirtualization technique on VMware's platform.
+	These hardware assisted virtualization techniques have outperformed the
+	performance benefits provided by VMI in most of the workloads. VMware
+	expects that these hardware features will be ubiquitous in a couple of
+	years, as a result, VMware has started a phased retirement of this
+	feature from the hypervisor. We will be removing this feature from the
+	Kernel too. Right now we are targeting 2.6.37 but can retire earlier if
+	technical reasons (read opportunity to remove major chunk of pvops)
+	arise.
+
+	Please note that VMI has always been an optimization and non-VMI kernels
+	still work fine on VMware's platform.
+	Latest versions of VMware's product which support VMI are,
+	Workstation 7.0 and VSphere 4.0 on ESX side, future maintainence
+	releases for these products will continue supporting VMI.
+
+	For more details about VMI retirement take a look at this,
