This is part of the Reseller Submission Policy, and only applies if
there is a "parent submission" that has gone through the WHQL process.

I think that the best technical solution would be to use a different
subsystem vendor ID, so long as both the WHQL process and Windows
Update supports this approach.

Why not BSD license the drivers and get them into Windows Update?
Citrix donated their drivers to the Xen Project and licensed them
under the BSD license. It makes this process a lot easier...

See win-* prefixed projects in https://github.com/xenserver, now
moved to pvdrivers/win repositories in http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb
