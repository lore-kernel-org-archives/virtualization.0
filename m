        I can. I was looking mostly at size (and this is the smallest
of the bunch). But the feature requires all of them together, of course.
This last one is just "everything left over" from the other two.

        This leaves no blank line between the declarations and the start
of code. It's habit for me-- not sure of kernel coding standards address
that or not, but I don't think I've seen it anywhere else.

        I added this to separate the logical "skip header" block from
the next, unrelated piece. Not important to me, though.

        I guess you mean put_user() or copy_to_user(); yes, I suppose
it could be paged since we read it.
        The code doesn't assume that it'll fit so much as arranged for
it to fit. We allocate guest_hlen bytes in the buffer, but set the
iovec to the (smaller) sock_hlen; do the read, then this code adds
back the 2 bytes in the middle that we didn't read into (where
num_buffers goes). But the allocator does require that guest_hlen
will fit in a single buffer (and reports error if it doesn't). The
alternative is significantly more complicated, and only fails if
the guest doesn't give us at least the buffer size the guest header
requires (a truly lame guest). I'm not sure it's worth a lot of
complexity in vhost to support the guest giving us <12 byte buffers;
those guests don't exist now and maybe they never should?

        Again, separating declarations from code-- never seen different
in any other kernel code.

        It redefines "empty". Without mergeable buffers, we can empty
the ring down to nothing before we require notification. With
mergeable buffers, if the packet requires, say, 3 buffers, and we
have only 2 left, we are empty and require notification and new
buffers to read anything. In both cases, we notify when we can't
read another packet without more buffers.
        I can think about changing the comment to reflect this more
clearly.

        This is a way for me to dynamically guess how many heads I need 
for a
max-sized packet for whatever the MTU/GRO settings are without waiting to
detect the need for more buffers until a read fails. Without mergeable 
buffers,
we can always fit a max-sized packet in 1 head, but with, we need more 
than
one head to do the read.

I didn't want to hard-code 64K (which it usually is, but not always), and
I didn't want to wait until a read fails every time the ring is near full.
I played with re-enabling notify on 1/4 available or some such, but that 
delays
reads unnecessarily, so I came up with this method: use maxheadcount to 
track
the biggest packet we've ever seen and always make sure we have at least 
that
many available for the next read. If it increases, we may fail the read, 
which'll
notify, but this allows us to notify before we try and fail in normal 
operation,
while still not doing a notify on every read.

                                                                +-DLS
