Yes, that makes sense. So the bug is that we aren't doing this right now.

Yeah, probably. I should have probably used "reported" instead of
"balloon" in the comment.

That is kind of what I was thinking. The problem is that once again
the current implementation works when page poisoning is enabled. Us
disabling that wouldn't make much sense.

The whole thing with the reporting is that we are essentially just
ballooning in place. What we may do at some point in the future would
be to add an additional feature bit to do that for the standard
balloon/hinting case. Then when that is set, and we know the contents
won't match we can then just skip the madvise or hinting calls. That
way it becomes an opt-in which is what the poison was supposed to be,
but wasn't because the QEMU side was never implemented.

In the meantime I still have to make more changes to my QEMU patch
set. The way the config_size logic is implemented is somewhat of a
pain when you factor in the way the host_features and poison were
handled.
