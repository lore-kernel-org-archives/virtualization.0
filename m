Hi Asias,

Looks nice! Some comments inline below (I've removed anything that mst already
commented on).

Why did it require hacking in the first place? Does running with kvmtool
and just doing regular networking over virtio-net running on top of vsock
achieves the same goal?

controlq is "defined but not used", is there something in mind for it? if not,
does it make sense keeping it here? we can always re-add it to the end just
like in virtio-net.

How does the driver tell the device how many vqs it's planning on actually using?
or is it assumed that all of them are in use?

For the previous packet? For the entire session? Reading ahead makes it clear but
it's worth mentioning here the context just to make it easy for implementers.
