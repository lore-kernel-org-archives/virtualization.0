This is indeed broken, because it is a "negative" feature: it tells you
that "implicit deflate" is _not_ supported.

Right now, QEMU refuses migration if the target does not support all the
features that were negotiated.  But then:

- a migration from non-MUST_TELL_HOST to MUST_TELL_HOST will succeed,
which is wrong;

- a migration from MUST_TELL_HOST to non-MUST_TELL_HOST will fail, which
is useless.

That would work.  At the same time we could deprecate MUST_TELL_HOST.
Certainly the guest implementations don't care, or we would have
experienced problems such as the one above.  The QEMU implementation
also does not care but, for example, a Xen implementation would care.
