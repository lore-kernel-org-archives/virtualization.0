Forget about the licensing.  Loading binary blobs written to a shim
layer is a complete pain in the ass and totally unsupportable, and
also uninteresting because of the overhead.

If you have any interesting in developing this further, do:

 (1) move the limited VF drivers directly into the kernel tree,
     talk to them through a normal ops vector
 (2) get rid of the whole shim crap and instead integrate the limited
     VF driver with the full VF driver we already have, instead of
     duplicating the code
 (3) don't make the PV to VF integration VMware-specific but also
     provide an open reference implementation like virtio.  We're not
     going to add massive amount of infrastructure that is not actually
     useable in a free software stack.
