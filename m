I think what Dave is suggesting is that we use the reloc information the
compiler generates to find the patchable callsites rather than have
special wrappers.  This is an interesting idea.

Not really.  There are only three cases:

   1. replace an indirect call with a direct call
   2. nop out a callsite
   3. patch in a short inline sequence

And as I pointed out, this is used by all pv_op backends, using a common
piece of code to implement at least 1 and 2.  3 could be implemented
semi-generically by using rules like "if (func == native_sti) {
patch("sti"); }", which would cover many cases where a hypervisor
doesn't need any special handling for a particular operation.

The goal is to eliminate the cost of the indirect calls with nice
predictable indirect calls.  There's a 1 byte/callsite overhead, but I
don't think that's a horrible overhead.

And, at worst, its only a little more complex than the kinds of
transformations.

Ideally, its a mechanism which could be used elsewhere.  It applies with
you have some kind of ops_vector table which is updated once (or perhaps
very rarely), and you don't want to wear the overhead of indirect calls
everywhere.

I don't think this is a relevant comparison.  This is purely a matter of
optimising out unnecessary indirect calls.

One of the explicit goals of pv_ops was to allow a single kernel to
either boot on native hardware or under any one of the supported
hypervisors, explicitly to avoid having to manage multiple kernel
images.  Compiling the kernel N+1 times for N hypervisors, and then
bundling them up in some kind of multi-image format doesn't seem like a
particularly good tradeoff.  The kernel RPM on my machine here is
already ~50Mbytes; expanding that to 250Mbytes to support native, Xen,
vmi, lguest and kvm doesn't seem reasonable.
