The +2 (i.e., extra +1) is for the virtio GSO header.

Theoretically yes :) But for virtualisation the underlying transport
may present meta-physically contiguous memory that is physically
discrete.  So we may actually need to have multiple SG entries for
skb->data.  However, no current code path should generate packets
with both long skb->data areas *and* skb page frags so we could
just drop them if they show up.

Cheers,
