Not with the current code, but possibly with SNP #VC exceptions:

      ->  First #VC
	  -> NMI before VC handler switched off its IST stack
	     (now on NMI IST stack)
	      -> Second SNP #VC exception before the NMI handler did the
		 #VC stack check (because HV messed around with some pages
		 touched there).

In the second #VC you use the same IST stack as in the first #VC, but
the the NMI-stack in-between.

It doesn't use the full unwinder, it just assumes that there is a
pt_regs struct at the top of every kernel stack and walks through them
until SP points to a user-space stack.

As long as the assumption that there is a pt_regs struct on top of every
stack holds, this should be safe. The assumption might be wrong when an
exception happens during SYSCALL/SYSENTER entry, when the return frame
is not written by hardware.
