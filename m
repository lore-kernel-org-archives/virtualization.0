That's very subtle, and easy to overlook.  So please don't do it.  Make
it obvious that you will not constantly loop, and again, don't call goto
backwards.  goto is for error handling only, unless you are writing
scheduler code, and you aren't doing that here.

Please rework your logic before resending this.
