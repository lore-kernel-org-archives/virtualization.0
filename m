Yes but note how that rewind does not involve modifying the ring.
It just rolls back some indices.

I am not sure it matters whether a VQ or the config are used to start/stop.
But I think flushing is very fragile. You will easily run into races
if one of the actors gets out of sync and keeps adding data.
I think adding an ID in the free vq stream is a more robust
approach.
