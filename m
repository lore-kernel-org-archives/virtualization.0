Not entirely surprising.  Curious if you ran specjbb w/ small pages too?

Typically we give time measured in multiple release cycles
before deprecating a feature.  This means placing an entry in
Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt, and potentially
adding some noise to warn users they are using a deprecated
feature.
