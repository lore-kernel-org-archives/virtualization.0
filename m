The race is inherently present in the way the virtqueue setup is done. Spec
defines many registers with side-effects. Like device_feature_select,
device_status, queue_select, queue_reset etc... Fabricating responses for these
registers properly would require trap-and-emulate as the endpoint cannot
reliably generate the response, once written. It may work sometimes, but not
always.

virtio-msg is a message based transport, just like virtio-pci. It has no
knowledge of the top level Virtio protocol. Using it will eliminate all the
shortcomings of the virtio-pci transport as the config steps between the
driver and device is message-response based.
