I see this attitude from Michal again and again.

He didn't want to fix vmalloc(GFP_NOIO), he didn't want to fix alloc_pages 
sleeping when __GFP_NORETRY is used. So what should I say? Fix them and 
you won't be evil :-)

(he could also fix the oom killer, so that it is triggered when 
free_memory+cache+free_swap goes beyond a threshold and not when you loop 
too long in the allocator)

I already said that we can change it from CONFIG_DEBUG_VM to 
CONFIG_DEBUG_SG - or to whatever other option you may want, just to make 
sure that it is enabled in distro debug kernels by default.
