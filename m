That reset should only happen when guest driver resets the device.
And spec already has a mechanism for that anyway.

I see. I don't think this is what the need reset was designed for.

We can extend it to cover this case but let's add a bit more
documentation then.

And in particular won't it be better if we could just reset one ring,
and not the whole device state? This might be nicer so flows on other
rings aren't disrupted.

In this particular case, won't it be easier for device to just
report all packets as used, without involving the guest?

I wonder if we can teach kernel to drop zero copy packets too.
