BTW I don't see a need to avoid deflateq.
Without MUST_TELL_HOST you can just deflate and then
bounce telling the host out to a thread.

This is the MUST_TELL_HOST.

Not exactly. It is not silent. It tells host
just after use.

So this case is just existing interface. OK.

This last trickery confuses me.  It just does not make sense to set both
SILENT and TELL: either you are silent or you tell.

What is the benefit of avoiding host notification?
It seems cleaner for the host to know the state.
