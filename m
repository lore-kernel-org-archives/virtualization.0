Would firmware upgrades ever result in major OS visible changes though?

Maybe OSes are more robust with SCSI than with other types of buses, but I don't 
think it's safe to completely ignore the problem.

Is that true for all OSes?  Linux may handle things gracefully if UNMAP starts 
throwing errors but that doesn't mean that Windows will.

There are other cases where this creates problems.  Windows (and some other 
OSes) fingerprint the hardware profile in order to do license enforcement.  If 
the hardware changes beyond a certain amount, then they refuse to boot.

Windows does this with a points system and I do believe that INQUIRY responses 
from any local disks are included in this tally.

It's the responsibility of the hypervisor when dealing with live migration.
