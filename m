Hi Rick,

In the future, please don't cut the list.

This was cut because it didn't make sense for such a warning to
be issued, but it seems like perhaps you may want such a feature?  I
agree with Michael, after thinking about it, that I don't know what sort
of use the warning would serve.  After all, if you're changing the MTU,
you must have wanted such a change to occur?
