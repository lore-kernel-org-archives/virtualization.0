Sigh. The cut zero hairball is already in mainline. :(

Fair enough.

Sure. If the clockevent API is changed, then the users get fixed. This
is not my main concern. The "oh we reuse the PIT interrupt" reachout is
what makes life hard. VMI does this already extensive and I'm frightened
by it.

Granted.

We'll see.
