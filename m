I've seen you have a notify_ops in the vmci bits.  Do you have different
notify ops depending on socket type or something?  Does it make sense to
move the notify ops ptr into "struct vsock_sock" maybe?

And can we make it optional please (i.e. allow the function pointers to
be NULL)?

Sounds not so good.  However, it is still not very clear what this
notification stuff is all about.  And it's not just notification, the
calls can return errors too.

Which problem you are trying to tackle with the notifications?

As one would expect from the names, good.

Yes, please.

How you'd hit that?  Peer closing the socket while sleeping?  Other
thread closing the socket wile sleeping?  Both?

I think a state field in struct vsock_sock would be a better solution here.

Can we make those calls optional too please?

I don't see a immediate need for them in the virto transport, but it's
hard to say without knowing what exactly they are doing.

Hmm.  The struct content seems to be vmci-specific and it is in generic
code, which isn't that nice.

The notify_*_init could return a opaque pointer instead.  But then
you'll need a notify_*_free too.  And you can't place it on the stack
and thus have a allocation in the hot path, which I guess you are trying
to avoid in the first place.

No good idea offhand, but maybe that changes if the purpose of all those
notify_* calls is more clear.

cheers,
  Gerd
