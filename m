Both my tests on arm64 and x86 are under KVM, and looks the
patch can improve performance a lot. IMO, even though under
KVM, virtio-blk performance still depends how well hypervisor(
qemu, ...) emulates the device, and basically speaking, it is
expensive to switch from guest to host and let host handle the
notification.
