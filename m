For example, a hypervisor could show hyper-v, osx-v (if any), linux-v, etc., and a guest could create a VM with hyper-v MMU, osx-v interrupt handling, Linux-v timer, etc. And such combinations/variations can grow exponentially.

The guest chooses what it wants to use.  We already do this: for 
example, we use CPUID leaf 0x80000006 preferentially to CPUID leaf 2, 
simply because it is a better interface.

And you're absolutely right that the guest may end up picking and 
choosing different parts of the interfaces.  That's how it is supposed 
to work.
