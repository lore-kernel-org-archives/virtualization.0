Actually, len could well be three bytes smaller than write_len. The spec
doesn't require the device to write the three padding bytes in
virtio_iommu_req_tail, after the status byte.

Here the driver just assumes that the device wrote the reserved field.
The QEMU device seems to write uninitialized data in there...

Any objection to changing the spec to require the device to initialize
those bytes to zero? I think it makes things nicer overall and shouldn't
have any performance impact.

Not as straightforward as I hoped, when the device doesn't support
VIRTIO_IOMMU_F_BYPASS:

* We can't simply create an ID map for the whole input range, we need to
carve out the resv_mem regions.

* For a VFIO device, the host has no way of forwarding the identity
mapping. For example the guest will attempt to map [0; 0xffffffffffff]
-> [0; 0xffffffffffff], but VFIO only allows to map RAM and cannot take
such request. One solution is to only create ID mapping for RAM, and
register a notifier for memory hotplug, like intel-iommu does for IOMMUs
that don't support HW pass-through.

Since it's not completely trivial and - I think - not urgent, I'll leave
this for later.

Thanks,
Jean
