virtio on it's own was introduced to help solve the fragmentation around virtualized devices, so I don't think that the main purpose of doing virtio drivers is due to any performance benefits virtio may provide.

Also consider virtio devices which don't exactly have strict performance considerations such as virtio-9p or virtio-rng.

I mean, why implement virtio-rng when qemu could just emulate some sort of a hardware RNG and just grab randomness from the host?

Don't understand me wrong, I'm not saying that there's something with the watchdog driver in qemu. All I want is to write a watchdog driver for lkvm which can take advantage of the fact it runs within a guest.

Will do!
