I understand we don't care here about older kernels and I will do what you
have suggested. I just wanted to give you the rationale for choices I made:
We are currently supporting older distros/kernels using these upstream bits.
With the MODULE_ALIAS() approach, since I did not have to change any code
outside the hv directory, this was possible. I was mostly concerned about 
having to make changes to code outside the hv directory and figuring out 
how to build and propagate these changes (file2alias.c) in older kernels.

We have four drivers now excluding vmbus and soon we will have only three
drivers with the merge of block and stor drivers. Would you still recommend I use the
full guid to name these drivers. Rather than embedding the entire 128bit guid in module
aliases, I was thinking of setting up a more reasonable namespace for these drivers
(like what virtio has done for instance). Let me know if this is ok with you if I took that
route (mapping the guid to small integers and having these integers be used in alias strings).
