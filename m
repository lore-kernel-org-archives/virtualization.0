Thanks, Baolu. I suppose so (by 'legacy', Jean was refers to ECS, and he
knows this is no longer supported).

It seems we have now reached a consensus that no PASID table needs to be
managed by a pvIOMMU for VT-d.

Meanwhile, it's worth noting that this is not the case for ARM SMMUv3,
which is the opposite. And as to AMD IOMMU, we may choose either.
