This is version 0.7 of the virtio-iommu specification. The diff from 0.6,
included below, is fairly small and consists of the following changes:

* Address comments from 0.6, rework bits of the implementation notes.

* Change resv_mem parameters to be consistent with the rest of the
  spec.

* Add the MMIO flag to MAP requests. At the moment it is used by
  mapped MSIs mostly for completeness, but will be important for IDENTITY
  resv_mem regions that next versions introduce. Please find more
  information about this on the v0.6 thread [1].

  For mapped MSIs, the MMIO flag allows host userspace to easily catch MSI
  maps, and route the rest to VFIO. Without it the host needs to check
  addresses against the MSI doorbell on every map request, before passing
  them down to VFIO. This version makes the flag mandatory in MMIO map
  requests. It could be useful on the unmap request as well but adding
  such flag seems unintuitive (and changes unmap semantics, no way to do
  unmap-all anymore). Adding both flags showed barely any performance
  improvement on my kvmtool prototype. Please let me know if you notice
  anything interesting on the QEMU and vhost prototypes, if you get around
  comparing this.

* A notable change to protection semantics: write-only may imply
  read-write (but read-only never implies read-write). We need this
  behavior because some architectures do not support write-only mappings
  and the corresponding host drivers don't reject write-only map requests.
  I chose to follow POSIX mmap() semantics for this ("if the application
  requests only PROT_WRITE, the implementation may also allow read
  access.")

I'll send the updated Linux driver, which you can find on my
virtio-iommu/devel branch, after the merge window.

Next RFCs should be more interesting, with support for page table sharing
and some optimizations. It is progressing nicely but there isn't any rush,
since we're currently discussing the host-side interface in VFIO, which
virtio-iommu will try to follow closely. Since I'm working on a few
related projects, expect a similar cadence (around four months) for next
versions.
