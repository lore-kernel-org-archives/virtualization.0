IMHO refining in-tree is fine.
This is the purpose of staging after all.

From my side the minimum requirement is to have
vsock_(un)register_transport calls available, so it is possible to write
a virtio transport module without having to patch vsock code to hook it
up.  Having the vsock bits in staging would actually make it a bit
easier to add virtio.

In the end it is Greg's / Dave's call though as those have to ack &
merge the bits.

Yes, should be transport specific (and optional).  virtio will (at least
initially) support guest <=> host only, so we don't need a context id.

Yes, please, that is needed too to get started with virtio support.

Ok.

Sure.  Was just wondering.  TCP can bind stream sockets to interfaces to
listen -- for example -- on loopback only.  I can't see something
simliar which makes sense for vsock.

cheers,
