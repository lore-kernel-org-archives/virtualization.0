On second thought, the unfair qspinlock may not be as bad as other 
unfair locks. Basically, a task gets one chance to steal the lock. If it 
can't, it will go to the back of the queue and wait for its turn. So 
unless a single CPU can monopolize a lock by acquiring it again 
immediately after release, all the tasks queuing up will eventually has 
its chance of getting the lock.
