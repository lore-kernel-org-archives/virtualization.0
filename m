Are you using kvm-tool to do this?  QEMU can already hot-plug ports
and virtio-console (virtio-serial) devices.

I don't really understand why.  "fix locking of vtermno" adds locks in
init_port_console(), which is called from add_port(), which should be
serialised due to port additions being on work items on the same
workqueue.  I don't see a race here.

I don't see any difference in my testing with and without these
patches.

This is how I tested with qemu:

./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512 -smp 2 -chardev
socket,path=3D/tmp/foo,server,nowait,id=3Dfoo -chardev
socket,path=3D/tmp/bar,server,nowait,id=3Dbar -device virtio-serial
-device virtconsole,chardev=3Dfoo,nr=3D4 -device
virtconsole,chardev=3Dbar,nr=3D3 -net none  -kernel
/home/amit/src/linux/arch/x86/boot/bzImage -append 'root=3D/dev/sda1
console=3Dtty0 console=3DttyS0' -initrd /tmp/initramfs.img
/guests/f14-nolvm.qcow2 -enable-kvm -snapshot

With this setup, with and without patches, I can spawn two consoles
via:

/sbin/agetty /dev/hvc0 9600 vt100
/sbin/agetty /dev/hvc1 9600 vt100

(Strange thing is, the second one gives a 'password incorrect' error
on login attempts, while the first one logs in fine.  I do remember
testing multiple consoles just fine a year and a half back, so no idea
why this isn't behaving as expected -- but it mostly looks like a
userspace issue rather than kernel one.)

As mentioned earlier, I've not looked at the hvc code, but given my
testing results, I'd like to first understand what you're seeing and
what your environment is.
