I thought one of the points was that building kernel with c++ catches
some bugs, no?  If the point is to make life easier for c++ userspace
I'm not sure what we can do to be frank. C++ seems to be adding new
keywords with no restraint (C99 did it with inline and restrict too, but
it seems this stopped) so no good way to future-proof code for all
language dialects.

So I'd like to know which are the actual c++ users asking for this - we
can then accomodate the specific version they need.
Meanwhile people can get by with a wrapper along the lines of
#define class _class
#include <linux/virtio_net.h>
#undef class
