You assume that getrandom works like /dev/random. This is not the case. It is 
a full deterministic RNG like /dev/urandom (which is seeded during its 
operation as entropy is available).

getrandom *only* differs from /dev/*u*random in that it waits initially such 
that the system collected 128 bits of entropy.

But you point to a real issue: when /dev/random is pulled before getrandom 
(and yet insufficient entropy is present), then the getrandom call will be 
woken up when the input_pool received 128 bits. But those 128 bits are fed 
from the input_pool to the blocking_pool based on the caller at the /dev/
random device. This implies that the reader for getrandom will NOT be able to 
obtain data from the input_pool and the nonblocking_pool because the transfer 
operation will not succeed. This implies that the nonblocking_pool remains 
unseeded and yet getrandom returns data to the caller.

That is a different issue that I did not read from your initial explanation.

I need to look into it a bit deeper.

right -- the kernel has now an in-kernel link that makes rngd superflowous in 
this case.
