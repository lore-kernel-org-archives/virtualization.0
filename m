I think I copied the ordering from kvm since it seems to work there,
maybe it doesn't for your device if the kvm path is still an unknown.
Logically it does seem like we'd want to unmap and release before the
final reset, but I can't find that those paths actually cause
interactions where it would matter.

Since we first disable the device and free the interrupt config it seems
like we should be relatively at ease restoring the saved config prior to
reset and, as you suggest, re-ordering the unmap and region release.
That leaves us with something like below.  Does that work better for
your device?  Anyone on linux-pci have advice on ordering of
pci_reset_function?  Thanks,

Alex
