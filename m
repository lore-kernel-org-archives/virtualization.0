OK, you do have posted coalescing patches - does it help any?

I'm not sure the regression is due to interrupts.
It would make sense for CPU but why would it
hurt transaction rate?

It's possible that we are deferring kicks too much due to BQL.

As an experiment: do we get any of it back if we do
-        if (kick || netif_xmit_stopped(txq))
-                virtqueue_kick(sq->vq);
+        virtqueue_kick(sq->vq);
?

If yes, we can just kick e.g. periodically, e.g. after queueing each
X bytes.
