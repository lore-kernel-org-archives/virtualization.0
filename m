There's an aio_init in block-raw-posix.c that sets the thread count to 
1.  If you #if 0 out that block, or increase the threads to something 
higher (like 16), you should see multiple simultaneous requests.  Sorry 
about that, I had that in a different patch in my tree.

The virtio block backend isn't quite optimal right now.  I have some 
patches (that are currently suffering bitrot) that switch over to 
linux-aio which allows zero-copy and for proper barrier support (so the 
guest block device will use an ordered queue).  The QEMU aio 
infrastructure makes it tough to integrate it properly though.
