So I don't think the HCAs or Infiniband fabric was the limiting factor
for small block random I/O in the RHEL 6.2 w/ OFED vs. Windows Server
2008 R2 w/ OFED setup mentioned earlier.

I've seen both FC and iSCSI fabrics demonstrate the same type of random
small block I/O performance anomalies with Linux/SCSI clients too.  The
v3.x Linux/SCSI clients are certainly better in the multi-lun per host
small block random I/O case, but single LUN performance is (still)
lacking compared to everything else.

Also RHEL 6.2 does have the scsi-host-lock less bits in place now, but
it's been more a matter of converting OFED ib_srp code to run in
host-lock less mode to realize extra gains for multi-lun per host.
