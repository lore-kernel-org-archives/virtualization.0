It's the "normal" way of cleaning up code.  Start with a known-working
piece of stuff, and incrementally clean it up.  This way if I mess any
of the individual steps up, it's easy to find the problem.  This has
already paid off in the past week working with the Microsoft developers
to get this into a buildable / workable state.

The code still needs lots of cleanup, and review, as is evident by the
TODO file.  It looks like the patches did get sent to the driver-devel
and virtualization lists, so you can see them there if you want to.

But if you want, I can post the 4 individual drivers as of right now,
what they will show up in the linux-next tree tomorrow if you want me
to.

thanks,
