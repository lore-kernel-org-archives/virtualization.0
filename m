Is it possible to have tap create these queues automatically when
TUNSETIFF is called instead of having userspace to do the new
ioctls. I am just wondering if it is possible to get multi-queue
to be enabled without any changes to qemu. I guess the number of queues
could be based on the number of vhost threads/guest virtio-net queues.

Also, is it possible to enable multi-queue on the host alone without
any guest virtio-net changes?

Have you done any multiple TCP_RR/UDP_RR testing with small packet
sizes? 256byte request/response with 50-100 instances?
