Yes, userspace shouldn't have access to the entire physical key slot
range. The host kernel or other VMs may need key slots and an untrusted
QEMU process must not be able to modify those key slots or use them for
I/O.

The uapi design should include a solution for this. For example, there
could be an ioctl like BLKCRYPTOSEALKEYS that permanently restricts the
key range on this block device file descriptor and cannot be undone.
Libvirt or other management tooling would call this ioctl with
CAP_SYS_ADMIN before passing the file descriptor when launching QEMU
without CAP_SYS_ADMIN. This prevents QEMU from ever having access to the
full physical key range.

Just an idea. Those familiar with blk-crypto may have a better one. It
seems likely that we can find a design that matches the level of
security of the out-of-band approach.

This sounds like an approach that skips key programming and instead
sends the keys along with each I/O request. The device implementation is
responsible for managing key slots on the physical ICE. My main concern
with this would be whether the blk_crypto_ll_ops semantics can be
faithfully replicated (e.g. error reporting) without explicit key
programming operations.
