I wrote a whole email on ways to do this, BUT...

Perhaps our patching code can already be vastly simplified to something
like:

#define pv_patch(call, args...) \
	asm volatile("8888:"); 
	call(args);
	asm volatile("8889:"
	 [ stuff to put 8889, 8888 and call in fixup section ]

The patching code doesn't even need to decode between those two: it
simply looks for an indirect call insn (0xff 0xd?).  If it finds more
than one, it doesn't patch.  If it only finds one, it patches.  We'll
probably hit them all just doing that.

Reading Ben LaHaise's (very cool!) patch, it's not clear that using
reloc postprocessing is going to be clearer than open-coding it as he
has done.
