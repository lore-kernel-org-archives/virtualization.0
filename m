Have to admit - I have no idea.
This work is based on emulated device so i'm my case - the emulated device
is creating the virtqueue. I guess that HW device will create a QP and
expose a virtqueue interface to it.
The same driver should serve both the SW and HW devices.

One of the objectives of this RFC is to collaborate an effort and
implementation notes/ideas from HW vendors.
