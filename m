I agree a full-blown bond isn't what is needed. However, just forking
traffic out from virtio to a VF doesn't really solve things either.

One of the issues as I see it is the fact that the qdisc model with
the merged device gets to be pretty ugly. There is the fact that every
packet that goes to the VF has to pass through the qdisc code twice.
There is the dual nature of the 2 netdev solution that also introduces
the potential for head-of-line blocking since the virtio could put
back pressure on the upper qdisc layer which could stall the VF
traffic when switching over. I hope we could avoid issues like that by
maintaining qdiscs per device queue instead of on an upper device that
is half software interface and half not. Ideally the virtio-bond
device could operate without a qdisc and without needing any
additional locks so there shouldn't be head of line blocking occurring
between the two interfaces and overhead could be kept minimal.

Also in the case of virtio there is support for in-driver XDP. As
Sridhar stated, when using the 2 netdev model "we cannot support XDP
in this model and it needs to be disabled". That sounds like a step
backwards instead of forwards. I would much rather leave the XDP
enabled at the lower dev level, and then if we want we can use the
generic XDP at the virtio-bond level to capture traffic on both
interfaces at the same time.

In the case of netvsc you have control of both sides of a given link
so you can match up the RSS tables, queue configuration and everything
is somewhat symmetric since you are running the PF and all the HyperV
subchannels. Most of the complexity is pushed down into the host and
your subchannel management is synchronized there if I am not mistaken.
We don't have this in the case of this virtio-bond setup. Instead a
single bit is set indicating "backup" without indicating what that
means to topology other than the fact that this virtio interface is
the backup for some other interface. We are essentially blind other
than having the link status for the VF and virtio and knowing that the
virtio is intended to be the backup.

We might be able to get to a 2 or maybe even a 1 netdev solution at
some point in the future, but  I don't think that time is now. For now
a virtio-bond type solution would allow us to address most of the use
cases with minimal modification to the existing virtio and can deal
with feature and/or resource asymmetry.
