It should be fairly easy. You just need to implement the kick right?
An IPI should be all that is needed - look in xen_unlock_kick. The
rest of the spinlock code is all generic that is shared between
KVM, Xen and baremetal.

You should be able to run all of this under an HVM guests as well - as
in you don't need a pure PV guest to use the PV ticketlocks.

An easy way to install/run this is to install your latest distro,
do 'yum install xen' or 'apt-get install xen'. Reboot and you
are under Xen. Launch guests, etc with your favorite virtualization
toolstack.
