Is there an alternate mechanism for pci to use? (Not so familiar with
it.)

For ccw, this needs more thought. We already introduced two commands
for reading/writing the config space (a concept that does not really
exist on s390). There's the generic read configuration data command,
but the data returned by it is not really generic enough. So we would
need one new command (or two, if we need to write as well). I'm not
sure about that yet.

So the presence of the id would indicate "this is one part of a pair"?

That feels a bit odd. "This is the vfio device's mac, use this instead
of your usual mac property"? As we have not designed the QEMU interface
yet, just go with the id in any case? The guest can still match by mac.

FC extensions are a completely different kind of enhancements, though.
For a start, they are not unique to a certain transport.

Also, we have a whole list of special dasd issues. Weird disk layout
for eckd, low-level disk formatting, etc. (See the list of commands in
drivers/s390/block/dasd_eckd.h for an idea. There's also no public
documentation AFAICS; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECKD does not link
to anything interesting.) I don't think we want to cram stuff like this
into a completely different framework.
