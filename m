As I understand in Xen dom0 kexec/kdump case machine_kexec() should call
stub which should call relevant hypercall to initiate kexec/kdump in
Xen itself. Right?

OK, but this solves problem in crash_kexec() only. However, kernel_kexec()
still calls machine_shutdown() which breaks kexec on Xen dom0 (to be precise
it shutdown machine via hypercall). Should I add machine_kexec_shutdown()
(like machine_crash_shutdown()) which would call, let's say,
machine_ops.kexec_shutdown()?

Additionally, crash_shrink_memory() does not make sens in Xen dom0 case.
How do you wish disable it if kexec_use_firmware is the wrong mental model?

OK.
