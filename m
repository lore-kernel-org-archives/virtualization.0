Right, because user space has to have a way to figure out what to do.

But talking about the firmware memmap, indicating something via a "raw
firmware-provided memory map", that is not actually in the "raw
firmware-provided memory map" feels wrong to me. (below)

We have documentation for that since 2008. Andrews patch is from 2010.

Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-firmware-memmap

It clearly talks about "raw firmware-provided memory map" and why the
interface was introduced at all ("on most architectures that
firmware-provided memory map is modified afterwards by the kernel itself"=
).

> Why does the firmware map support hotplug entries?

I assume:

The firmware memmap was added primarily for x86-64 kexec (and still, is
mostly used on x86-64 only IIRC). There, we had ACPI hotplug. When DIMMs
get hotplugged on real HW, they get added to e820. Same applies to
memory added via HyperV balloon (unless memory is unplugged via
ballooning and you reboot ... the the e820 is changed as well). I assume
we wanted to be able to reflect that, to make kexec look like a real rebo=
ot.

This worked for a while. Then came dax/kmem. Now comes virtio-mem.


But I assume only Andrew can enlighten us.

@Andrew, any guidance here? Should we really add all memory to the
firmware memmap, even if this contradicts with the existing
documentation? (especially, if the actual firmware memmap will *not*
contain that memory after a reboot)
