Hi Gerd,

Thanks so much for taking a look and apologies for the delay!

Yes, right now everything is still munged into one driver.

When you say final, do you mean something that we have to do before
acceptance into mainline or something we can refine over time?  I'm
rather hoping for the latter: it'd be nice to come to an agreement
about whether VM Sockets is the right way to go, and actually get
this in, before we go to the trouble of splitting this out, only to
find that nobody actually implements their own transport ;)

A CID, or "context ID" is how we identify a VM.  It's also in
the address structure (svm_cid).  If you look at vm_sockets.h,
you'll see that we have definitions for various endpoints (the
host, anonymous and so forth).  It's sometimes useful for VMs
to be able to query their own ID, for example, to be able to
pass it out-of-band via INET to a peer.  So we'd like to keep
this, although I guess it should be transport-defined, i.e.,
we should ask the transport for this value.

Yes, it's still totally topsy-turvy.  But see comment about coming
to an agreement :)

I'm fixing this.

The transport just enqueues sk_buffs in the socket's buffer, so the
core socket code can just pull them off.  So there's no explicit
recv_dgram.

Ah, for our transport, there's nothing special involved in binding a
STREAM, everything is handled by the core socket code.  So I didn't
add a transport callback.  This is something we can add when it
becomes necessary, if that's okay?

Fixed.

Fixed.

> What does unregister?

That's topsy-turvy unregistration, it drops the transport.  It will go
away eventually.

I'll send out a patch soon addressing the (easy) issues above.

Thanks!
