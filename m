Virtme looks interesting. If it's any use, here is my modest QEMU command line
collection.

$dir/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu/qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -m 1024 \
  -kernel $dir/boot/x86_64-linux-gnu/bzImage-x86_64 \
  -append 'root=/dev/root init=/sbin/x86_64-linux-gnu/init rootfstype=9p
rootflags=trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L ro console=ttyS0' \
  -serial stdio \
  -fsdev local,id=root,path=$dir,security_model=none \
  -device virtio-9p-pci,fsdev=root,mount_tag=/dev/root \
  -monitor none

$dir/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu/qemu-system-arm \
