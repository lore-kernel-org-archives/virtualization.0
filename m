In previous my posting, what I mean was absolute guaranteeing for
minimum bandwidth, regardless of disk seek time, I/O type(sequential,
random, or mixed =85) of process.
I also basically prefer proportional share depending on priority or
weight and I think it is meaningful, such like as dm-ioband, 2-layer
CFQ(satoshi) and 2-Layer CFQ(vasily).
But, additionally in that situation, I think absolute guaranteeing of
the minimum bandwidth will be required and several related companies
want it to be supported. Because proportional share has inaccuracy of
performance predictability, as Andrea mentioned before.
So, to complement the point, IMHO, I think so.

Yes, I agree with you. This was what I intend to say
