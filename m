You should consider teaching QEMU that the platform has support for the
ultravisor thing so it can set flags for you.

That's true even if something else is done for virtio - if you don't
have the capability right now you will come to regret it, host userspace
is just fundamentally in charge of control-path enumeration in the KVM
stack, I understand you want to take some of it away for security but
trying to hide things from QEMU completely is a mistake IMHO.

Just my $.02.

What you sent to Ram sounds OK to me - I only hope we do all mean
the same thing because the 3 paragraphs above are all
about the libvirt/QEMU split mess which linux or virtio
should not really care about.

And I'd like to stress that direct path isn't merely legacy.

It's a common sense approach that when you have a hypervisor doing
things like taking care of cache coherency, you do not want to do them
in the guest as well. And the same guest can use a pass-through device
where it does need to do all the coherency mess, so while it's quite
possible to build a platform-specific way to tell guests which devices
need which kind of treatment, people understandably chose to do it in a
portable way through the virtio device.

I understand you guys are working on a new project that is going to use
bounce buffers anyway so what do you care about optimizations but we
can't just slow everyone else down for your benefit.

Isn't above exactly what you sent to Ram?
