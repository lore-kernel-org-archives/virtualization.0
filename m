Looking at the code for complete(), it looks like the "done" state is incremented
each time complete() is invoked and  the  code for do_wait_for_common() decrements the 
done state each time it is invoked (if the completion is properly signaled and we are not dealing
with a timeout. So, what am I missing here.

This is called from the probe functions and these errors are percolated up. On a different
note, I cleaned up this code based on the feedback I got from you. The patches have been 
sent out.
