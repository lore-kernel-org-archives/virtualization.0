OK, thanks for the suggestions. I think one more issue left here:

Previously, when the guest receives a config interrupt, it blindly adds 
the balloon work item to the workqueue in virtballoon_changed(), because 
only ballooning uses the config.
Now, free page reporting is requested via config, too.

We have the following two options:

Option 1: add "diff = towards_target()" to virtballoon_changed(), and if 
diff = 0, it will not add the balloon work item to the wq.

Option 2: add "cmd" for the host-to-guest request, and add the item when 
"cmd | CMD_BALLOON" is true.

I'm inclined to take option 1 now. Which one would you prefer?

Best,
Wei
