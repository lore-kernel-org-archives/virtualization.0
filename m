I've been working on forward porting Xenfied Linux.
Now I have domU boot and disk/network working with linux 2.6.25-rc1.
I'm planning to post those patch in this week. At worst I'll post
the cpu virtualization part which is discussed in this thread.
For those curious, please see
http://people.valinux.co.jp/~yamahata/xen-ia64/20080214/xen-ia64-20080214.patch
Sorry for the single jumbo patch, I'm now splitting it up into many
small patches for post.

Although ivt.S has the top priority, but there are other two codes which 
xen paravirtualizes currently.

pal.S:
More specifically ia64_pal_call_static()
Maybe we can go without paravirtualized ia64_pall_call_static().
Since pal static convension is very stable, having implementation 
or each paravirtualization technology might be acceptable because
it won't cause maintenance const much.

entry.S:
The kernel leaving point. This is the counter part of ivt.S.
More concretely ia64_switch_to(), ia64_leave_syscall() and
ia64_leave_kernel(). They require certainly paravirtualization
because they include sensitive instructions and performance critical.
Those functions can't be switched very easily compared to the ivt
case so that some kind of facitilty which switch those or 
binary patching them are necessary.

Pros:
- Optimal code can be possible for native and each paravirtualized case.
- Doesn't introduce any further restriction on native case.

Cons:
- Ugly and maintenance cost as you already stated.

Pros:
- single code
- hopefull less maintenance cost compared to #1

Cons:
- requires restriction on register usage. And we need to define its
  convension.
  When modifying ivt.S in the future after converting ivt.S,
  those convesion must be kept in mind.
- suboptimal for paravirtualized case compared to #1 case

#2B may also need clobber 1(or 2?) GR registers depending on the
original instruction.

Pros:
- single code/binary
- less maintenance cost

Cons:
- requires restriction on register usage. And we need to define its
  convension.
  When modifying ivt.S in the future after converting ivt.S,
  those convesion must be kept in mind.
- more clobbered register (for AltC)
- suboptimal even for native case.

Presumably we can use binary patching technique to mitigate those overhead.
Probably for native case, we can convert those branch with single
instruction.
For example we can make 'br breg0' into direct branch.
AltD(AltC'):
        breg1 = return address;
        br  native_pv_ops_ops   <=== binary patch at boot time

The final goal is merging up Xenified Linux/IA64 domU/dom0 code.
I expect that it requires many clean up and abstraction.
The first step is merging domU first and it would requires 
- XenLinux portabiliy clean up
  Those kind of patches can be pused into upstream independently
- cpu instruction paravirtualization
  - assembly code
  - instrinsics
- iosapic paravirtualization(event channel)
- xen irq chip
- and more...
