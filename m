You create a patch like any other patch and give it to the people who
are stuck with those older kernels.  It shouldn't be that hard, and it
also shouldn't be something that matters for this mainline work either.

Yes, why not?

What's the big deal of having a large number as an alias?  Is there some
constraint here that I am not aware of?
