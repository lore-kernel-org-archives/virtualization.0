The MIPS SYNC isn't any worse than the PPC SYNC, x86 MFENCE or arm DSB
SY, yes they're heavy, so what.

Ha! and you think that document covers all the really fun details?

In particular we're very much all 'confused' about the various notions
of transitivity and what barriers imply how much of it.

What ?! Are you saying that because R2 has short pipelines its unlikely
to hit the reordering issues and we can omit barriers?

That did not in fact enlighten things. Are they transitive/multi-copy
atomic or not?

(and here Will will go into great detail on the differences between the
two and make our collective brains explode :-)

Yes, the difference between RCpc and RCsc is in the meaning of RELEASE +
ACQUIRE. With RCsc that implies a full memory barrier, with RCpc it does
not.

Currently PowerPC is the only arch that (can, and) does RCpc and gives a
weaker RELEASE + ACQUIRE. Only the CPU who did the ACQUIRE is guaranteed
to see the stores of the CPU which did the RELEASE in order.

As it stands, RCU is the only _known_ codebase where this matters, but
we did in fact write code for a fair number of years 'assuming' RELEASE
+ ACQUIRE was a full barrier, so who knows what else is out there.

RCpc - release consistency processor consistency
