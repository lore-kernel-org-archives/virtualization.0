That is the general idea. I was hoping to go the bonding route last
week but I got too snarled up trying to untangle the features we
didn't need. I have some code I am working on but don't have an ETA
for when it will be done.

At this point I am hoping we can build something based on Sridhar's
original patch that can addresses the items I brought up and shifts to
more of a 3 netdev model. If I am not mistaken we might be able to do
it as a separate driver that has a pair of calls that allow for
adding/removing a virt-bond that is provided with a MAC address and a
device pointer so that we can do the bits necessary to get ourselves
swapped with the original virtio device and identify the virtio as the
backup channel.

Thanks.
