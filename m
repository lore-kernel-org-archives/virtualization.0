This happens when you have code that keeps
reference itself implicitly or explicitly.

	foo(struct kref *k, int bar) {

	sub = kref_sub(k)

	if (sub == 1)
		FOO(k, bar) /* Here I am the only one
			       with a reference */

	}

	kref_get(k)
	foo(k, bar);
	....
	kref_put(k)

Why not do FOO in destructor you ask?
Absolutely but this will be called much later.

Maybe you will reconsider if I document this
as the only legal use?

The issue is that if number dropped to 1, this means
we must do the cleanup work since there are
no outstanding buffers, (last user is ourselves)
if we do not cleanup,
guest will hang waiting for us.

But it never drops to 0 since we have our own reference
in the device.
If it goes up again this means we didn't have
to do cleanup, but an alternative is doing
it all the time and that is slow.

Yes I can rework vhost to open-code this kref use, it's
no big deal.
Alternatively since most of the use does match kref
model, maybe __kref_sub_return with disclaimers
that you must know what you are doing?
Please let me know.

Thanks!
