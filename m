QEMU could provide map a shared page with tap/macvtap.  The difference
would be that the guest<->host interface is still virtio and QEMU
pokes values into the shared page on behalf of the guest.

Then you need to find a better way of doing this.  Can the host
automatically associate the flow from the tx virtqueue packets are
transmitted on?  Does it make sense to add a virtio_net_hdr field that
updates the queue mapping?

The vcpus are just threads and may not be bound to physical CPUs, so
what is the big picture here?  Is the guest even in the position to
set the best queue mappings today?
