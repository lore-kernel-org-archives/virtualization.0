Ok I think there is an important question here. Why is this being
designed for a specific virtual interface. Unix has always had the notion
that socket operations can be in part generic and that you can pass a
properly designed program a socket without any notion of what it is for.

Does that not depend which side does the congestion and who parcels out
buffers ?

Q: whay happens about in process socket syscalls in another thread ?
Thats always been the ugly in these cases either by intercepting or by
swapping file operations on an object.

This guest only view means you can't use the abstraction for local
sockets too.

That makes a lot of sense to me, because its a well understood
abstraction and you can offload other stuff to this kind of generic
socket including things like http protocol acceleration, SSL and so on.

Plus its always been annoying that you can't open a socket, but a URI
interface solves that...

But there is no reason SEQPACKET and RDM couldn't be added I assume?

Ok other questions

Suppose instead you just add an abstracted socket interface of

	AF_SOMETHING, PF_URI

it would be easy to convert programs. It would be easier to write
properly generic programs. It would be easy write some small helpers that
are a good deal less insane than the existing inet ones. At that point
you could turn the problem on its head. Instead of 'borrowing' sockets
for a fairly specific concept of hw assist you ask the reverse question,
who can accelerate this URI be it some kind of virtual machine interface,
something funky like raw data over infiniband, or plain old 'use the
TCP/IP stack'.

Your decision making code is going to be interesting but it only has to
make the decision once in simple cases.

And yes there is still the complicated cases such as 'the routing table
has changed from vitual host to via siberia now what' but I don't believe
your proposal addresses that either.
