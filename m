Yes but how can it signal guest that it will never proceed?

Also grep for BUG_ON in core found this:

       drv->remove(dev);

       /* Driver should have reset device. */
       BUG_ON(dev->config->get_status(dev));

I think below is what Sjur refers to.
I think below is a good idea for 3.6. Thoughts?

virtio: don't crash when device is buggy

Because of a sanity check in virtio_dev_remove, a buggy device can crash
kernel.  And in case of rproc it's userspace so it's not a good idea.
We are unloading a driver so how bad can it be?
Be less aggressive in handling this error: if it's a driver bug,
warning once should be enough.
