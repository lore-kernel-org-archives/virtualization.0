We've addressed this with the latest patch series, which I sent earlier
today.  vSockets now has support for pluggable transports, of which VMCI
happens to be the first; all transport code is separated out into its
own module.  So the core is now hypervisor neutral.  Given that, would
you be willing to re-consider it, please?  If at all possible, we'd like
to make the current merge window.

Thanks so much!
