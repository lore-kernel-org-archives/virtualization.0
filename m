That's fine. RX/TX descriptors would not contain the data itself. They'd
contain pointers to actual packets (ie just like the NIC takes physical memory
address and DMAs data in/out).
The allows for sending/receiving packets without syscalls and fits nicely with
the async schemes like GSO.

btw The code that I sent you does indeed expect packets to be in a mmap()ed
buffer but I agree that it only works for certain cases. In general it's not
flexible. I was thinking of introducing some flags in the descriptor that tell
the kernel how to handle the packet. ie Whether it needs to be just copied
into a fresh SKB or remapped with get_user_pages().

I actually was going to abuse them from day one. At that time Alex Kuznetsov
told me that I'm crazy and I gave up on it :)

If we do the whole enchilada with the RX/TX rings then we probably do not even
need it. I'm thinking that RX/TX descriptor would include everything you need
for the GSO and stuff.
I meant do not need it for the TUN/TAP driver that is. Is it used anywhere else ?
