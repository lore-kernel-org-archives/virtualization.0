So, it won't receive much testing.

I've never played with those debugfs files (because I didn't need it), and 
most users also won't play with it. Having a debugfs option is like having 
no option at all.

Debug kernel is what distributions distribute as debug kernel - i.e. RHEL 
or Fedora have debugging kernels. So it needs to be bound to an option 
that is turned on in these kernels - so that any user who boots the 
debugging kernel triggers the bug.

Don't bind it to rc level, bind it to some debugging configuration option.
