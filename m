Yes, I agree, certainly that is what we were planning to target in the
first instance. Doing this means that we can get away with minimal
emulation of actual hardware, relying instead on PV drivers or hardware
virtualisation features.

Supporting specific board platforms as guests would be nice to have
eventually. We would need to do more emulation (e.g. running qemu as a
device model) for that case.

We were absolutely banking on targeting the results of this work, so
that's good ;-)
