Ask Intel? :)

Note that QEMU is not involved in the implementation of your feature,
only in advertising it.  You could look at CPUID at runtime, but that
would mean teaching KVM to look for the KVMKVMKVM\0\0\0 signature in the
CPUID data supplied by userspace.  I don't think this is particularly
useful.

Sure, I will look at it.  Though I expect it was done because of MSRs
that are missing in QEMU (similar to how Linux doesn't #GP if compiled
with pvops).
