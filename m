Me too :)

Yes, that's the problem (well, kind of the problem.)

You seem to be doing things a bit "odd" and that's due to the old way
the code was written.

First off, don't embed a struct bus_type in another structure, that's
not needed at all.  Why is that done?  Anyway...

In your vmbus_match function, you should be matching to see if your
device matches the driver that is passed to you.  You do this by looking
at some type of "id".  For the vmbus you should do this by looking at
the GUID, right?  And it looks like you do do this, so that's fine.

And then your vmbus_probe() function calls the driver probe function,
with the device it is to bind to.  BUT, you need to have your probe
function pass in the correct device type (i.e. struct hv_device, NOT
struct device.)

That way, your hv_driver will have a type all its own, with probe
functions that look nothing like the probe functions that 'struct
driver' has in it.  Look at 'struct pci_driver' for an example of this.
Don't try to overload the probe/remove/suspend/etc functions of your
hv_driver by using the "base" 'struct device_driver' callbacks, that's
putting knowledge of the driver core into the individual hv drivers,
where it's not needed at all.

And, by doing that, you should be able to drop your private pointer in
the hv_driver function completly, right?  That shouldn't be needed at
all.

No, you still want that, see above.

Kind of, see above for more details.

If you want a good example, again, look at the PCI core code, it's
pretty simple in this area (hint, don't look at the USB code, it does
much more complex things than you want, due to things that the USB bus
imposes on devices, that's never a good example to look at.)

Hope this helps.  Please let me know if it doesn't :)
