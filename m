I'd like to use it in powerpc. We have code now for example that patches=20
a branch immediately at the top of memcpy which branches to a different=20
version of the function. pv queued spinlock selection obviously, and
there's a bunch of platform ops struct things that get filled in at boot=20
time, etc.

So +1 here if you can get them through. I'm not 100% sure we can do
it with existing toolchain and no ugly hacks, but there's no way to
structure things that can get around that AFAIKS. We'd eventually
use it though, I'd say.

Thanks,
Nick
