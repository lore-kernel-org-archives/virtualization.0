Actually I have more data on this:

1. __GFP_NORETRY really does help and should go into stable tree.

2. You may want to consider GFP_NOKSWAPD, because even in the
GFP_ATOMIC case you are waking up kswapd to do reclaims on a
continuous basis even when you don't enter direct reclaim.

3. mlocking memory had very little to do with it, that was a
red-herring. I tested out the problem scenario with no mlocks. You
simply need memory pressure from page_cache, and mm ends up constantly
reclaiming and trying to keep another 1-2GB free on our systems (8GB
phys ~4GB left for kernel, ~3GB optimally used for page_cache).

4. I think perhaps using a kmem_cache allocation for this buffer is
the right way to make this work. I am experimenting with a patch to do
this.
