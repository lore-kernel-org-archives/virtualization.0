Apologies: it's me that wants the DMA ops enabled to handle legacy devices
behind an IOMMU, but see below.

That's true, although that doesn't exist in the legacy virtio spec, and we
have an existing emulation platform which puts legacy virtio devices behind
an IOMMU. Currently, Linux is unable to boot on this platform unless the
IOMMU is configured as bypass. If we can use the coherent IOMMU DMA ops,
then it works perfectly.

As above -- that means we hang during boot because we get stuck trying to
bring up a virtio-block device whose DMA is aborted by the IOMMU. The easy
answer is "just upgrade to latest virtio and advertise the presence of the
IOMMU". I'm pushing for that in future platforms, but it seems a shame not
to support the current platform, especially given that other systems do have
hacks in mainline to get virtio working.

I agree that this makes sense for future revisions of virtio (or perhaps
it can just be a clarification to virtio 1.0), but we're still left in the
dark with legacy devices and it would be nice to have them work on the
systems which currently exist, even if it's a legacy-only hack in the arch
code.
