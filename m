Have some experiments on this, looks like it does not work weel when clone_skb 
is used. For driver that call skb_orphan() in ndo_start_xmit, the destructor 
is only called when the first packet were sent, but what we need to know is 
when the last were sent. Any thoughts on this or we can just introduce another 
flag (anyway we have something like IFF_TX_SKB_SHARING) ?

Thanks
