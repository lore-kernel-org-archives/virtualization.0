Because semantically speaking, rcu_derefence*() and
lockless_dereference() are CONSUME(i.e. data/address dependent
read->read and read->write pairs are ordered), whereas
smp_read_barrier_depends() only guarantees read->read pairs with data
dependency are ordered, right?

If so, maybe we need to call it out in memory-barriers.txt, for example:

ers.txt
index 904ee42..6b262c2 100644
