This is misleading. You did not propose adding Intel processors to a whitelist,
for example in `cpu_supports_p2pdma()`. Instead, you explicitly added a check
for whether the system is running in a VM.

This is not how open-source development works. Let's work together to find a
solution that works for everyone.
