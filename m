mmh? not true. You can define a single cgroup subsystem that implements
the opportune interfaces to apply your type of control, and use many
structures allocated dynamically for each controlled object (one for
each block device, disk, partition, ... or using any kind of
grouping/splitting policy). Actually, this is how cgroup-io-throttle, as
well as any other cgroup subsystem, is implemented.

Why not a single control file for all the devices?
