You mean already full? Well, this one triggers even if queue
on guest side is not full. TCP might be ok with it, but I suspect
packet drops would be very bad for UDP.

Hmm, need to think about it as well.

qemu tells us how much of the header to skip before passing
it to socket.

I'l post a patch, and we'll see.

I mean hc.  Let's call it count and live with line wraps if you don't
like i.

Yes. hdrsize is kind of generic, socket is obviously net specific ...
