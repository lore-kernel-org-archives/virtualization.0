But if you save a pointer, you HAVE to increment the reference count.

Yes, but that's a bug, the pointer reference count should be
incremented.

Look at drivers/usb/usb-skeleton.c for a well-documented way to handle a
driver that works with a bus that has devices that could go away at any
point in time.  It handles the reference count, and the locking
correctly, and has been audited by lots of people.

But no, that's not the way to do it, put it in the structure that has
the data you are trying to protect.
