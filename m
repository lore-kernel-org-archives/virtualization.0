Ugh, it actually caches the status in the transport :(

Well, it's a nuisance, but the spec is out.
It seems to me a new command would be a substantive change so we can't
do this in errata.

Option (2) would require two statements for drivers and devices,
but since it's clearly the case for correct drivers/devices
that command does not fail, it follows that this
is not a substantive change so it can be fixed
in an errata.

So the new command would have to be optional, please open
two issues in the TC: one documenting that driver must check
WRITE_STATUS and device can fail WRITE_STATUS, and another
for adding READ_STATUS (which will have to wait until
the next CS).
