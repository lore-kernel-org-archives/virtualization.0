It most certainly has been made clear to me, numerous times from many
people in the Linux/SCSI community that there is a bottleneck for small
block random I/O in SCSI core vs. raw Linux/Block, as well as vs. non
Linux based SCSI subsystems.

My apologies if mentioning this issue last year at LC 2011 to you
privately did not take a tone of a more serious nature, or that
proposing a topic for LSF-2012 this year was not a clear enough
indication of a problem with SCSI small block random I/O performance.

The specific issue was first raised for .38 where we where able to get
most of the interesting high performance LLDs converted to using
internal locking methods so that host_lock did not have to be obtained
during each ->queuecommand() I/O dispatch, right..?

This has helped a good deal for large multi-lun scsi_host configs that
are now running in host-lock less mode, but there is still a large
discrepancy single LUN vs. raw struct block_device access even with LLD
host_lock less mode enabled.

Now I think the virtio-blk client performance is demonstrating this
issue pretty vividly, along with this week's tcm_vhost IBLOCK raw block
flash benchmarks that is demonstrate some other yet-to-be determined
limitations for virtio-scsi-raw vs. tcm_vhost for this particular fio
randrw workload.

It's really quite simple for anyone to demonstrate the bottleneck
locally on any machine using tcm_loop with raw block flash.  Take a
struct block_device backend (like a Fusion IO /dev/fio*) and using
IBLOCK and export locally accessible SCSI LUNs via tcm_loop..

Using FIO there is a significant drop for randrw 4k performance between
tcm_loop <-> IBLOCK vs. raw struct block device backends.  And no, it's
not some type of target IBLOCK or tcm_loop bottleneck, it's a per SCSI
LUN limitation for small block random I/Os on the order of ~75K for each
SCSI LUN.

If anyone has gone actually gone faster than this with any single SCSI
LUN on any storage fabric, I would be interested in hearing about your
setup.

Thanks,
