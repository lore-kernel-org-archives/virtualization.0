My preference is to err on the side of caution.  I view want_init_on
free() as equivalent to page_poison_enabled with
CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING_ZERO and treated the same way. So if we are
going to let one by then we would want to let the other by as well.

My concern is we can never see how things might be used in the future.
The advantage of setting the poison feature flag and leaving the value
as 0 is that it indicates that we are strictly expecting a zero page
versus allowing the page to contain some other content. I'm expecting
that in most cases that we should see that the page poisoning feature
will be present if page reporting is present so my thought is it is
safer to put the limitation on the guest rather than on the host as it
allows us more flexibility for future implementations.

Right. For free page hinting it is underspecified. By defining a tight
relationship between free page reporting and page poison we might be
able to better handle those sorts of cases. I suspect there may be
interest in having free page reporting eventually take on many of the
responsibilities of free page hinting as it doesn't have the extra
complication of having to consume all of the guests memory. If we
dictate that free page reporting has to have a very clear definition
in relation to any page initialization it lays the groundwork for us
to be able to eventually handle those kind of cases.
