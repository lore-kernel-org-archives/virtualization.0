metrics are exact right now.

As soon as you read a value, it might already have changed.

Maybe you want to stop_machine() to make sure all the metrics you want
are 'exact' ;)

But then you need atomic64 stuff, have you an idea of the cost of such
primitives on 32bit ?

3. use 32bit counters on 32bit arches, as many drivers still do ?
