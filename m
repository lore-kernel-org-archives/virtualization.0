Wrt QEMU this sounds reasonable. Wrt guest, deferring guest changes
a bit, until we have a better idea about how the host side behaves
sounds better to me than saying "this is how guests will behave,
let the host adapt to that".

Or at least disable it just if there are virtio devices.

This specific item wouldn't worry me too much.
