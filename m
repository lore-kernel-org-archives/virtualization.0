I would like to run with rcu checks enabled sometimes to debug kvm,
which has an elaborate rcu strategy.  Bogus warnings in the log
make it easy to overlook the real ones. Further, the rcu macros
used are a form of documentation. If we have
-               rcu_dereference_index_check(dev->acked_features,
-                                           lockdep_is_held(&dev->mutex));
this means 'taken in rcu read side critical section or under mutex',

+       acked_features = rcu_dereference_index_check(dev->acked_features, 1);
means 'not checked'.

Well, that's why I put in a TODO.
If there's a demand for that, I can add a Kconfig option to
trigger a warning at each unchecked rcu call in vhost-net
but I doubt it'll get a lof of use :)
