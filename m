Hi Amit,

> I'm sorry for not being able to look at this earlier.

No worries. I'll try to respin and retest this patch by tomorrow.
If you by any chance could find time to review so could make it in time
for 3.7 it would be great :-)

Sure, I'll based the next patch on linux-next.

Yes, as mention to Michael earlier. I use rproc_serial for talking
to a modem running in early boot phases, before the OS has started,
or when the modem is executing it's crash handler. In both these 
cases the modem run in a very limited execution environment, so
I want to keep the protocol and handling of the vqs as simple as
possible. Due to this I really don't want more than single pair
of vqs.

We also have very simple use-cases. The port is opened once
in the life-time of the modem, and only reopened after a
cold-start of the modem. So I should not get into any issues
with race conditions.

With the current usage pattern I have in mind, I'd rather add this
feature later when/if needed. We can always add a new feature bit
for this if we introduce the control channel later on.

Ok, I'll change this.

Yes, it was cleaner when I started using port_buffer more place.
And as mentioned below, I'll start using port buffer from
put_chars() as well, this will improve a few things.

Sure, I'll rename these.

Actually I do need this check. The reason is that I am
exploiting gcc's ability to discard dead code. When I compile
for arch's that does not have DMA, this block is dead and will be
discarded. This way I avoid the link error for the missing
symbol dma_free_coherent(). But I can add a comment on this.

Yeah, I did an earlier version without goto, but I wanted to separate
the rproc / non-rproc clearly to make it easier to see what happened
if rproc was disabled. But I'll have a stab at refactoring this code
again.

OK, I'll fix this.

OK, so the issue here it that currently put_chars() passes a
char-buffer to send_buf() instead of a port_buffer. The tests above
tries to handle this case, distingusing between a tty and char device.
I agree that this is not the best solution.

But if I change put_chars to create a port_buffer and copy
data into it I can avoid the crap you pointed at above.

I need this test because virtio_check_driver_offered_feature() called
from virtio_has_feature will throw a BUG() if you test on a feature
not declared in the driver's feature-set.

It used to do that, but not anymore. This patch
changes kzalloc() to kmalloc() in alloc_buf()

Agree, the only reason is that I did memset was not to change legacy
behavior. I'd prefer to skip the memset too, so let's do that.

OK, I'll keep assignments before "if" and skip the else part.
