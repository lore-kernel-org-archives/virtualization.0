Hi Kame,

Looking at CFQ, there are two issues.

- RT tasks (and RT priorities with in that)
- Best Effort class tasks (and priorities with in that).

To make sure we don't break underlying CFQ elevator, we need to take care of 
both the things in higher level scheduler. This will mean practically we
will end up copying code from CFQ in higher level scheduler.

Even if I do that (Keep track of RT tasks and Best effort class tasks and 
their proirities and do dispatch accordingly), I am not sure will it have
any negative impact when a user is using AS IO scheduler on the leaf node.

That forces me to think that if we can let go the idea of doing
proportionate bandwidth allocation at higher level logical device and just
do it for leaf nodes, then we can drop the idea of two level scheduler and
try to bring unification among four IO schedulers such that with least 
code copying they can also support proportional weight policies.

Thanks
Vivek
