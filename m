I think "page" and "page_cgroup" is not so heavly shared object in fast path.
foot-print is also important here.
(anyway, I'd like to remove lock_page_cgroup() when I find a chance)

maybe no. it will be encoded into struct page.

yes, of course.

But it's not good for the systems with small "NORMAL" pages.
This discussion should be done again when more users of page_group appears and
it's overhead is obvious.
