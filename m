Ok, thanks.

BTW, I found a better description by Tom Herbert, BTW:
        https://code.google.com/p/kernel/wiki/NetScalingGuide

Now, I find the description of VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_STEERING_RX_FOLLOWS_TX
confusing:

1) AFAICT it turns on multiqueue rx, with no semantics attached.
   I have no idea why it's called what it is.  Why?

2) We've said we can remove steering methods, but we haven't actually
   defined any, as we've left it completely open.

If I were a driver author, it leaves me completely baffled on how to
implement the spec :(

What are we actually planning to implement at the moment?

Why is this true?  I don't actually see why the queues are in pairs at
all; are tx and rx not completely independent?  So why does it matter?

How can this be done?  This isn't actually possible without taking the
queue down, since more packets are incoming.

Cheers,
Rusty.
