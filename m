We don't pass the whole VF to the guest. Only the BAR which is responsible for
TX/RX/intr is mapped into guest space. The interface between the shell and
plugin only allows to do operations related to TX and RX such as send a packet
to the VF, allocate RX buffers, indicate a packet upto the shell. All control
operations are handled by the shell and the shell does what the existing
vmxnet3 drivers does (touch a specific register and let the device emulation do
the work). When a VF is mapped to the guest the hypervisor knows this and
programs the h/w accordingly on behalf of the shell. So for example if the VM
does a MAC address change inside the guest, the shell would write to
VMXNET3_REG_MAC{L|H} registers which would trigger the device emulation to read
the new mac address and update its internal virtual port information for the
virtual switch and if the VF is mapped it would also program the embedded
switch RX filters to reflect the new mac address.

To some extent yes but there is no complicated bonding nor there is any thing
like a PCI hotplug. The shell interface is small and the OS always interacts
with the shell as the main driver. Based on the underlying VF the plugin
changes and this plugin as well is really small. Our vmxnet3 s/w plugin is
about 1300 lines with whitespaces and comments and the Intel Kawela plugin is
about 1100 lines with whitspaces and comments. The design principle is to put
more of the complexity related to initialization/control into the PF driver
rather than in plugin.

In NPA we do not rely on the guest OS to provide any of these services like
bonding or PCI hotplug. We don't rely on the guest OS to unmap a VF and switch
a VM out of passthrough. In a bonding approach that becomes an issue you can't
just yank a device from underneath, you have to wait for the OS to process the
request and switch from using VF to the emulated device and this makes the
hypervisor dependent on the guest OS. Also we don't rely on the presence of all
the drivers inside the guest OS (be it Linux or Windows), the ESX hypervisor
carries all the plugins and the PF drivers and injects the right one as needed.
These plugins are guest agnostic and the IHVs do not have to write plugins for
different OS.
