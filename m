Thanks for the explanation.

The LS byte of the lock word is used to indicate locking status. If we 
have less than 255 cpus, we can put the (cpu_nr + 1) into the lock byte. 
The special 0xff value can be used to indicate a cpu number >= 255 for 
indirect yield. The required change to the qspinlock code will be 
minimal, I think.

I will just like to see if it will produce some better performance 
result compared with your current version.
