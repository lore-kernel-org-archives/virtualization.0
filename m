Memory barriers aren't _always_ requested, only when you need to order
accesses to multiple locations.

In this case, there is no other location that the
queuecommand/completion handlers needs to synchronize against, so no
barrier is required.  You can see plenty of atomic_inc/atomic_dec in the
code without a barrier afterwards (the typical case is the opposite as
in this patch: a refcount increment needs no barrier, a refcount
decrement uses atomic_dec_return).

This is with a mixed workload (random 4k-64k) and tmpfs backend on the host.

I need to look into it, to understand how the queue steering here can be
adapted to his code.

Agreed.
