Hmm, so this will busy wait which is unelegant.
We need some event IMO.
Also, reading num_pages without a lock here
which seems wrong.

A similar concern applies to normal leaking
of the balloon: here we might leak less than
required, then wait for the next config change
event.

How about we signal config_change
event when pages are back to pages_list?
