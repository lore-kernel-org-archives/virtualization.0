The Leaf 0x40000000 returns vendor identifier signature (i.e. hypervisor identification) and the hypervisor CPUID leaf range, as in the proposal.

In other words, 0x40000002+ is vendor-specific space, based on the 
hypervisor specified in 0x40000001 (in theory); in practice both 
0x40000000:0x40000001 since M$ seem to use clever identifiers as 
"Hypervisor 1".

What I'm saying is that Microsoft is effectively squatting on the 
0x400000xx space with their definition.  As written, it's not even clear 
that it will remain consistent between *their own* hypervisors, even 
less anyone else's.
