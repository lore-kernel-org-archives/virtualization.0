I think VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT is really the special case and
shall be left alone (not messed with VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST).
Initiated by the host, complicated protocol and semantics, guest can
reuse pages any time it wants ("hint").

VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_REPORTING is *basically* ordinary inflation on
stereoids (be able to report a size for each page and multiple pages in
one go) BUT, we can currently *never* have
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST semantics - there is no deflation.

We could rename VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_REPORTING to something like
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_SIZE and make it obey to
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST (meaning, there would have to be a
deflate queue as well!) - but it contradicts to the real needs.
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_REPORTING comnbined with
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST would not be usable by Linux for free
page reporting.

Well, as QEMU never sets VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST we would be
fine. Alexander would have to add an inflate+deflate queue and make his
feature depend on !VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST.

Is that the consistency you're looking for? Alexander, thoughts?
