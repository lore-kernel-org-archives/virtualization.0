hypervisor_start:
	.incbin "hypervisor"
hypervisor_end:

...
	extern char hypervisor_start[], hypervisor_end[];

	size = hypervisor_end - hypervisor_start;

This means it is not SMP safe?

This means nobody will know why it failed.

gcc has a handy extension for this: 

case 0...FIRST_EXTERNAL_VECTOR-1:
case SYSCALL_VECTOR:
case FIRST_EXTERNAL_VECTOR...FIRST_EXTERNAL_VECTOR+LGUEST_IRQS:


Re: the loops; e.g. we used to have possible loop cases
when a page fault does read instructions and then causes another
page fault etc.etc. I haven't seen any immediate danger of this,
but it might be worth double checking.
