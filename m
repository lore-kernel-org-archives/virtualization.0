Exactly as it does now. You don't get to tweak alignment then.

Basically each field gets an offset.  E.g.
24 - features
28 - queue alignment

I guess my assumption is that most options will be in use,
not discarded dead-ends.

It started out this way, but then they started running out
of space - it's only 256 bytes - so the capability mechanism
was invented.
