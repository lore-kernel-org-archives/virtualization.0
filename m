When we're about two weeks away from a product release and you are =

threatening to unmerge or block our code because we didn't create an =

abstract interrupt controller, we re-used the APIC and IO-APIC, this is =

uber rocket science.  We've been doing things this way, with public =

patches for over a year, and you've even been CC'd on some of the =

discussions.  So it is a little late to tell us - "redesign your =

hypervisor, or else.."

Why?  This is your own invention, as you think it would make life =

easier.  It doesn't - you still have real hardware to deal with, and =

your code will always be designed to operate on silicon with these =

hardwired assumptions.  Breaking away from that can actually make the =

code more complex, both in the hypervisor and in Linux.

Which we have done.  And now you refuse to give any feedback on =

technical points, but maintain an objection to the way we have done it.

We faithfully emulate lapic, io_apic, the pit, pic, and a normal =

interrupt subsystem.  We can't magically stop using these things because =

we have to support traditional full virtualization.  Which means any =

version of Linux, virtual interrupt controller or not, is going to boot =

up, find these things, and try to use them.  So for a paravirt kernel, =

either we have to disable each of these things in the Linux code or just =

re-use them.

So we re-use them.  We don't even change their semantics.  Where we get =

into trouble is the fact that only the lapic can deliver per-cpu timer =

IRQs, and we need to provide a better time abstraction than TSC.  So we =

need a time device, but there is no way to implement it in the =

traditional hardware model.

And I ask again for your feedback on which approach you think is correct:

1) Rewrite the interrupt subsystem of our hypervisor, making it =

incompatible with full virtualization, so that we can support an =

abstract interrupt controller with a "clean" interface
2) Reuse the same method that HPET, PIT and other time clients in i386 =

use - the global_clock_event pointer which allows you to wrest control =

back from the APIC and reuse the lapic_events local clockevents.
3) Create a new low level interrupt handler for the per-cpu VMI timer =

IRQs instead of re-using the APIC handler
4) Use the irq APIs to allocate IRQ-0 as a percpu IRQ, then change the =

IO-APIC code so it can know not to convert this PIC IRQ into a IO-APIC =

edge IRQ.
5) Disable the io-apic code entirely in paravirt mode.  Rather than =

change it, merge a parallel copy of it into the VMI code
 so that we can use the 99% of the code we need, with the one bugfix for =

#4 above
6) Disable the apic code entirely in paravirt mode.  Rather than change =

it, merge a parallel copy of into the VMI code so that we can use the =

90% of the code we need, with changes to the LVT0 timer handling.
7) For SMP only, allocate a non-shared IO-APIC IRQ, then after the =

IO-APIC is initialized, magically switch this to a percpu handler and =

start delivering local timer interrupts via this IRQ.
8) Create a pie-in-the-sky single interrupt source, reserve an IDT =

vector for it (or steal the lapic timer slot), and use the irq apis to =

set it up to be handled as a per-cpu interrupt.  This actually sounds =

pretty good, to me.  The only problem is we will need to switch the =

timer IRQ from IRQ 0 to this vector when the APIC is initialized, but I =

think we already have all the machinery we need to handle that.
9) ???

This is a serious question, I would appreciate a serious response =

instead of snide comments about the crappiness of our interface and our =

code.  Which do help a little, because by process of elimination,  we =

can rule out the approaches you don't like.  But it would be more =

productive if we could carry on a traditional dialogue and I could just =

ask a question and you could answer and vice versa.
