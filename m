Well, that's also for these reasons that I think your patch shouldn't go
through those virtio_* variants that test that "use_dma_api" flag or
whatever you called it last time I looked :-)

You should just unconditionally call the DMA API and we should fixup the
special cases by overriding the hooks.

I can help you do the override hack for PPC for now, until we can do
something saner accross all architectures.

The main problem is s390 but I had a quick chat with Utz Bacher earlier
this week and he seemed to think having s390 use the DMA API shouldn't
be a big deal, they can also hookup some transparent set of ops if
necessary.

Cheers,
Ben.
