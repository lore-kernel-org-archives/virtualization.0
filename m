Actually Shreyas showed me his raw patch and it had tabs and not spaces, so we're trying to figure out if either Outlook (corporate blessed) or our Exchange server is converting those tabs to spaces or something.

Ah, that's always fun.  You can check by mailing to yourself and looking
at the outcome.

So far it looks like there's a small performance gain with microbenchmarks like netperf, but we're hoping having multiple queues with multiple vectors might have some promise with macro benchmarks like SPECjbb. If it pans out, we'll most likely make it a module_param with some reasonable defaults, possibly just 1/1 by default.

Most physical devices that do MSI-X will do queue per cpu (or some
grouping if large number of cpus compared to queues).  Probably
reasonable default here too.

Interesting.  Sounds like part of NetQueue and also something that virtio
has looked into to support, e.g. VMDq.  Do you have a more complete
spec?
