+What's dm-band all about?
+========================
+Dm-band is an I/O bandwidth controller implemented as a device-mapper driver.
+Several jobs using the same physical device have to share the bandwidth of
+the device. Dm-band gives bandwidth to each job according to its weight, 
+which each job can set its own value to.
+
+At this time, a job is a group of processes with the same pid or pgrp or uid.
+There is also a plan to make it support cgroup. A job can also be a virtual
+machine such as KVM or Xen.
+

+
+How dm-band works.
+========================
+Every band device has one band group, which by default is called the default
+group.
+
+Band devices can also have extra band groups in them. Each band group
+has a job to support and a weight. Proportional to the weight, dm-band gives
+tokens to the group.
+
+A group passes on I/O requests that its job issues to the underlying
+layer so long as it has tokens left, while requests are blocked
+if there aren't any tokens left in the group. One token is consumed each
+time the group passes on a request. Dm-band will refill groups with tokens
+once all of groups that have requests on a given physical device use up their
+tokens.
+
+With this approach, a job running on a band group with large weight is
+guaranteed to be able to issue a large number of I/O requests.
+
+
+Setup and Installation
+======================
+
+Build a kernel with these options enabled:
+
+  CONFIG_MD
+  CONFIG_BLK_DEV_DM
+  CONFIG_DM_BAND
+
+If compiled as module, use modprobe to load dm-band.
+
+  # make modules
+  # make modules_install
+  # depmod -a
+  # modprobe dm-band
+
+"dmsetup targets" command shows all available device-mapper targets.
+"band" is displayed if dm-band has loaded.
+
+  # dmsetup targets
+  band             v0.0.2
+
+
+Getting started
+=============
+The following is a brief description how to control the I/O bandwidth of
+disks. In this description, we'll take one disk with two partitions as an
+example target.
+
+
+Create and map band devices
+---------------------------
+Create two band devices "band1" and "band2" and map them to "/dev/sda1"
+and "/dev/sda2" respectively.
+
+ # echo "0 `blockdev --getsize /dev/sda1` band /dev/sda1 1" | dmsetup create band1
+ # echo "0 `blockdev --getsize /dev/sda2` band /dev/sda2 1" | dmsetup create band2
+
+If the commands are successful then the device files "/dev/mapper/band1"
+and "/dev/mapper/band2" will have been created.
+
+
+Bandwidth control
+----------------
+In this example weights of 40 and 10 will be assigned to "band1" and
+"band2" respectively. This is done using the following commands:
+
+ # dmsetup message band1 0 weight 40
+ # dmsetup message band2 0 weight 10
+
+After these commands, "band1" can use 80% --- 40/(40+10)*100 --- of the
+bandwidth of the physical disk "/dev/sda" while "band2" can use 20%.
+
+
+Additional bandwidth control
+---------------------------
+In this example two extra band groups are created on "band1".
+The first group consists of all the processes with user-id 1000 and the
+second group consists of all the processes with user-id 2000. Their
+weights are 30 and 20 respectively.
+
+Firstly the band group type of "band1" is set to "user".
+Then, the user-id 1000 and 2000 groups are attached to "band1".
+Finally, weights are assigned to the user-id 1000 and 2000 groups.
+
+ # dmsetup message band1 0 type user
+ # dmsetup message band1 0 attach 1000
+ # dmsetup message band1 0 attach 2000
+ # dmsetup message band1 0 weight 1000:30
+ # dmsetup message band1 0 weight 2000:20
+
+Now the processes in the user-id 1000 group can use 30% ---
+30/(30+20+40+10)*100 --- of the bandwidth of the physical disk.
+
+ Band Device    Band Group                     Weight
+  band1         user id 1000                     30
+  band1         user id 2000                     20
+  band1         default group(the other users)   40
+  band2         default group                    10
+
+
+Remove band devices
+-------------------
+Remove the band devices when no longer used.
+
+  # dmsetup remove band1
+  # dmsetup remove band2
+
+
+Command Reference
+=================
+
+
+Create a band device
+--------------------
+SYNOPSIS
+  dmsetup create BAND_DEVICE
+
+DESCRIPTION
+  The following space delimited arguments, which describe the physical device
+  may are read from standard input. All arguments are required, and they must
+  be provided in order the order listed below.
+
+    starting sector of the physical device
+    size in sectors of the physical device
+    string "band" as a target type
+    physical device name
+    device group ID
+
+  You must set the same device group ID for each band device that shares 
+  the same bandwidth.
+
+  A default band group is also created and attached to the band device.
+
+  If the command is successful, the device file
+  "/dev/device-mapper/BAND_DEVICE" will have been created.
+
+EXAMPLE
+  Create a band device with the following parameters:
+    physical device = "/dev/sda1"
+    band device name = "band1"
+    device group ID = "100"
+
+    # size=`blockdev --getsize /dev/sda1`
+    # echo "0 $size band /dev/sda1 100" | dmsetup create band1
+
+  Create two device groups (ID=1,2). The bandwidth of each device group may be
+  individually controlled.
+
+    # echo "0 11096883 band /dev/sda1 1" | dmsetup create band1
+    # echo "0 11096883 band /dev/sda2 1" | dmsetup create band2
+    # echo "0 11096883 band /dev/sda3 2" | dmsetup create band3
+    # echo "0 11096883 band /dev/sda4 2" | dmsetup create band4
+
+
+Remove the band device
+----------------------
+SYNOPSIS
+  dmsetup remove BAND_DEVICE
+
+DESCRIPTION
+  Remove the band device with the given name. All band groups that are attached
+  to the band device are removed automatically.
+
+EXAMPLE
+  Remove the band device "band1".
+
+  # dmsetup remove band1
+
+
+Set a band group's type
+-----------------------
+SYNOPSIS
+  dmsetup message BAND_DEVICE 0 type TYPE
+
+DESCRIPTION
+  Set a band group's type. TYPE must be one of "user", "pid" or "pgrp".
+
+EXAMPLE
+  Set a band group's type to "user".
+
+  # dmsetup message band1 0 type user
+
+
+Create a band group
+-------------------
+SYNOPSIS
+  dmsetup message BAND_DEVICE 0 attach ID
+
+DESCRIPTION
+  Create a band group and attach it a band device. The ID number specifies the
+  user-id, pid or pgrp, as per the the type.
+
+EXAMPLE
+  Attach a band group with uid 1000 to the band device "band1".
+
+  # dmsetup message band1 0 type user
+  # dmsetup message band1 0 attach 1000
+
+
+Remove a band group
+-------------------
+SYNOPSIS
+  dmsetup message BAND_DEVICE 0 detach ID
+
+DESCRIPTION
+  Detach a band group specified by ID from a band device.
+
+EXAMPLE

+
+
+Set the weight of a band group
+------------------------------
+SYNOPSIS
+  dmsetup message BAND_DEVICE 0 weight VAL
+  dmsetup message BAND_DEVICE 0 weight ID:VAL
+
+DESCRIPTION
+  Set the weight of band group. The weight is evaluated as a ratio against the
+  total weight. The following example means that "band1" can use 80% ---
+  40/(40+10)*100 --- of the bandwidth of the physical disk "/dev/sda" while
+  "band2" can use 20%.
+
+    # dmsetup message band1 0 weight 40
+    # dmsetup message band1 0 weight 10
+
+  The following has the same effect as the above commands:
+
+    # dmsetup message band1 0 weight 4
+    # dmsetup message band2 0 weight 1  
+
+  VAL must be an integer grater than 0. The default is 100.
+
+EXAMPLE
+  Set the weight of the default band group to 40.
+
+  # dmsetup message band1 0 weight 40
+
+  Set the weight of the band group with ID "1000" to 10.
+
+  # dmsetup message band1 0 weight 1000:10
+

+  - Support WRITE_BARRIER.
+  - Optimization.
+  - More configuration tools. Or is the dmsetup command sufficient?
+  - Other policies to schedule BIOs. Or is the weight policy sufficient?
