Quite often, the biggest single win of inlining is not so much the code =

size (although if done right, that will be smaller too), but the fact that =

inlining DOES NOT CLOBBER AS MANY REGISTERS!

The lack of register clobbering, and the freedom for the compiler to =

choose registers around an inlined function is usually the biggest win! If =

you can't do that, then inlining generally doesn't actually even help: a =

call/return to a single instruction isn't all that much slower than just =

doing the "cli" in the first place.

If we end up with a setup where any inlined instruction needs to act as if =

it was a function call (just with the "call" instruction papered over with =

the inlined instruction sequence), then there is no point to this at all. =


In short: people here seem to think that inlining is about avoiding the =

call/ret sequence. Not so. The real advantages of inlining are elsewhere.

So *please* don't believe that you can make it "as cheap" to have some =

automatic fixup of two sequences, one inlined and one as a "call".  It may =

look so when you look at the single instruction generated, but you're =

ignoring all the instructions *around* the site.
