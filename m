Ok, I see.

Ah, very good.

Correct, but it needs to correspond to some platform that is supported
by the guest OS, which leaves the choice between emulating a real
hardware platform, adding a completely new platform specifically for
virtual machines, or something in between the two.

What I suggested to the KVM developers is to start out with the
vexpress platform, but then generalize it to the point where it fits
your needs. All hardware that one expects a guest to have (GIC, timer,
...) will still show up in the same location as on a real vexpress,
while anything that makes no sense or is better paravirtualized (LCD,
storage, ...) just becomes optional and has to be described in the
device tree if it's actually there.

In general that is the case, yes. One could argue that any software
protocol between Xen and the guest is as good as any other, so it
makes sense to use the device tree to describe all devices here.
The counterargument to that is that Linux and other OSs already
support Xenbus, so there is no need to come up with a new binding.

I don't care much either way, but I think it would be good to
use similar solutions across all hypervisors. The two options
that I've seen discussed for KVM were to use either a virtual PCI
bus with individual virtio-pci devices as on the PC, or to
use the new virtio-mmio driver and individually put virtio devices
into the device tree.

Ok. It would of course still be possible to agree on an argument passing
convention so that we can share the macros used to issue the hcalls,
even if the individual commands are all different. I think I also
remember talk about the need for a set of hypervisor independent calls
that everyone should implement, but I can't remember what those were.
Maybe we can split the number space into a range of some generic and
some vendor specific hcalls?
