I believe you, but I'm not convinced that this means much from the
guest's POV, except on ppc64.

But there aren't any ACPI systems with both virtio-pci and IOMMUs,
right?  So we could say that, henceforth, ACPI systems must declare
whether virtio-pci devices live behind IOMMUs without breaking
backward compatibility.

AFAIK QEMU doesn't support IOMMUs at all on x86, so current versions
of QEMU really do guarantee that virtio-pci on x86 has no IOMMU, even
if that guarantee is purely accidental.

Ugh.

So here's an ugly proposal:

Step 1: Make virtio-pci use the DMA API only on x86.  This will at
least fix Xen and people experimenting with virtio hardware on x86,
and it won't break anything, since there are no emulated IOMMUs on
x86.

Step 2: Update the virtio spec.  Virtio 1.0 PCI devices should set a
new bit if they are physically addressed.  If that bit is clear, then
the device is assumed to be addressed in accordance with the
platform's standard addressing model for PCI.  Presumably this would
be something like VIRTIO_F_BUS_ADDRESSING = 33, and the spec would say
something like "Physical devices compatible with this specification
MUST offer VIRTIO_F_BUS_ADDRESSING.  Drivers MUST implement this
feature."  Alternatively, this could live in a PCI configuration
capability.

Step 3: Update virtio-pci to use the DMA API for all devices on x86
and for devices that advertise bus addressing on other architectures.

I think this proposal will work, but I also think it sucks and I'd
really like to see a better counter-proposal.
