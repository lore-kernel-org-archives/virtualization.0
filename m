I would say all the PV stuffs are mostly useful for a over-committed 
guest where a single CPU is shared in more than one guest. When the 
guests are not overcommitted, the PV code seldom get triggered. In those 
cases, the overhead of the extra function call and register 
saving/restoring will show up.

Good point! I will do some investigation on how to do this kind of 
function address patching and eliminate the extra function call overhead.

I know you don't like this kind of preprocessor trick, but this is the 
easiest way that I can think of to generate two separate functions from 
the same source code.
