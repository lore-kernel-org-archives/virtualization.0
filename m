+ *
+ *	The %eax reg
+ *	Holds "struct lguest_pages" now:
+ *	Cherry blossoms fall.
+ *
+ * Then I started with Heroic Verse, but the rhyming requirement leeched away
+ * the content density and led to some uniquely awful oblique rhymes:
+ *
+ *	These constants are coming from struct offsets
+ *	For use within the asm switcher text.

+ * Finally, I settled for something between heroic hexameter, and normal prose
+ * with inappropriate linebreaks.  Anyway, it aint no Shakespeare.
