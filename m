Add multiqueue support to virtio network device.
Add a new feature flag VIRTIO_NET_F_MULTIQUEUE for this feature, a new
configuration field max_virtqueue_pairs to detect supported number of
virtqueues as well as a new command VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_STEERING to program
packet steering.

Changes from v2:
Address Jason's comments on v2:
- Changed STEERING_HOST to STEERING_RX_FOLLOWS_TX:
  this is both clearer and easier to support.
  It does not look like we need a separate steering command
  since host can just watch tx packets as they go.
- Moved RX and TX steering sections near each other.
- Add motivation for other changes in v2

Changes from Jason's rfc:
- reserved vq 3: this makes all rx vqs even and tx vqs odd, which
  looks nicer to me.
- documented packet steering, added a generalized steering programming
  command. Current modes are single queue and host driven multiqueue,
  but I envision support for guest driven multiqueue in the future.
- make default vqs unused when in mq mode - this wastes some memory
  but makes it more efficient to switch between modes as
  we can avoid this causing packet reordering.

Rusty, could you please take a look and comment?
If this looks OK to everyone, we can proceed with finalizing the
implementation.  This patch is against
eb9fc84d0d3c46438aaab190e2401a9e5409a052 in virtio-spec git tree.

+When VIRTIO_NET_F_MULTIQUEUE feature bit is negotiated, guest can use any
+ of multiple configured transmit queues to transmit a given packet.
+ To avoid packet reordering by device (which generally leads to performance
+ degradation) driver should attempt to utilize the same transmit virtqueue
+ for all packets of a given transmit flow.
+ For bi-directional protocols (in practice, TCP), a given network connection
+ can utilize both transmit and receive queues.
+ For best performance, packets from a single connection should utilize the
+ paired transmit and receive queues from the same virtqueue pair; for example
+ both transmitqN and receiveqN.
+ This rule makes it possible to optimize processing on the device side,
+ but this is not a hard requirement: devices should function correctly even
+ when this rule is not followed.
