Scratch that idea, then.

The best that I can currently come up with is to say that pre-1.0
devices on PPC bypass the IOMMU and that 1.0 devices on PPC and all
devices on all other architectures do not bypass the IOMMU.

I agree that this is far from ideal.  Any ideas?  Is there any other
channel that QEMU can use to signal to a PPC guest that a specific PCI
virtio device isn't really behind an IOMMU?  From my POV, the main
consideration is that existing QEMU versions hosting Xen hypervisors
should work, which is not the case in current kernels, but which is
the case with my patches without any known regressions.

Is there some evil trick that a PPC guest could use to detect whether
the IOMMU is honored?  As an example that I don't like at all, the
guest could program the IOMMU so that the ring's physical address maps
to a second copy of the ring and then see which one works.
