Fair enough!  ;-)

So smp_mb() can be SYNC_MB.  However, mb() needs to be SYNC for MMIO
purposes, correct?

Indeed!

Looks to me like smp_mb() can be SYNC_MB, then.

So you need to build a different kernel for some types of MIPS systems?
Or do you do boot-time rewriting, like a number of other arches do?
