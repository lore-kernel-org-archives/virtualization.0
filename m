The following tree has fixes for vhost-net for 2.6.39.
These are easier to apply on top of Jason's and Krishna's
cleanups, and they got tested this way, so I thought it's
better for everyone to include that, and the trivial
copy_from_user optimization.

But if you think it's too late for that, pls let me know
and I'll try to untangle that dependency.

Thanks!
