Ah I see what you mean. We started out calling this feature "multiqueue"
Rusty suggested "RFS" since it gives similar functionality to RFS but in
device: it has receive steering logic per flow as part of the device.

Maybe simply adding a statement similar to the one above would be
sufficient to avoid confusion?
