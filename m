It's simple. Driver does iowrite16 or whatever is appropriate for the OS.
QEMU tells KVM which address driver uses, to make exits faster.  This is not
different from how eventfd works.  For example if exits to QEMU suddenly become
very cheap we can remove eventfd completely.

Yep. But why?
Could be a different hardware. My laptop is i7, what did you measure on?
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
cpu family      : 6
model           : 42
model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2640M CPU @ 2.80GHz
stepping        : 7
microcode       : 0x28
cpu MHz         : 2801.000
cache size      : 4096 KB

Or could be different software, this is on top of 3.9.0-rc5, what
did you try?

I can't do this right away, sorry.  For MMIO we are discussing the new
layout on the virtio mailing list, guest and qemu need a patch for this
too.  My hcall patches are stale and would have to be brought up to
date.

Latency is dominated by the scheduling latency.
This means virtio-net is not the best benchmark.

It's the TSC divided by number of iterations.  kvm unittest this value, here's
what it does (removed some dead code):

#define GOAL (1ull << 30)

        do {
                iterations *= 2;
                t1 = rdtsc();

                        for (i = 0; i < iterations; ++i)
                                func();
                t2 = rdtsc();
        } while ((t2 - t1) < GOAL);
        printf("%s %d\n", test->name, (int)((t2 - t1) / iterations));
