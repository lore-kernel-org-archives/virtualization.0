Ah, interesting. I did not realize that the hooks were still active,
although that obviously makes sense. So that would be another
important difference between our implementations.

Right, that was my point. They bridge in VEPA mode would likely be
configured to be completely ignorant of the data going through it
and not do any filter, and you do all filterring on the adjacent
bridge.

I just wasn't sure that this is possible with ebtables if the
adjacent bridge is a Linux system with the bridge in hairpin turn
mode.
