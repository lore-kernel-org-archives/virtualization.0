The purpose of this email is to introduce the architecture and the design principles. The overall project involves more than just changes to vmxnet3 driver and hence we though an overview email would be better. Once people agree to the design in general we intend to provide the code changes to the vmxnet3 driver.

The architecture supports more than Intel NICs. We started the project with Intel but plan to support all major IHVs including Broadcom, Qlogic, Emulex and others through a certification program. The architecture works on VMware ESX server only as it requires significant support from the hypervisor. Also, the vmxnet3 driver works on VMware platform only. AFAICT Xen has a different model for supporting SR-IOV devices and allowing live migration and the document briefly talks about it (paragraph 6).

Thanks,
