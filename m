Hi,

I'm hitting this bug with both ext4 and btrfs.

Here's an example of the backtrace:
https://gist.github.com/vzctl/e888a821333979120932

I tried raising this BUG only for direct ring and it solved the problem:

 -       BUG_ON(total_sg > vq->vring.num);
+       BUG_ON(total_sg > vq->vring.num && !vq->indirect);

Shall I submit the patch or is a more elaborate fix required?

Alexey
