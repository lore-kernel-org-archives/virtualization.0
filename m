Yeah, it's a bit ugly.  The alternative is to have a separate
correctly-typed nop function for each operation.  But that's even more
typing.

The other two are arch_* and are called from common code. 
arch_activate_mm() is either empty or a call to
paravirt_ops.activate_mm.  I could name it paravirt_activate_mm (as it
was in earlier versions of this patch), but then it would be
inconsistent with the other functions.  I thought the consistency was
more important, because these calls need to be properly matched.

OK, I'll drop them.

I guess, if you want.  For everything except i386 (and x86_64 in the not
too distant future) they'll be noops.  But for consistency, I/we would
have to put the appropriate arch_activate_mm() into each arch's
activate_mm(); I seem to remember some were not as straightforward as i386.

OK.
