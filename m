Since the -b and -w are in the test-specific portion, this test was not actually 
  paced. The -w will have been ignored entirely (IIRC) and the -b will have 
attempted to set the "burst" size of a --enable-burst ./configured netperf.  If 
netperf was ./configured that way, it will have had two rr transactions in 
flight at one time - the "regular" one and then the one additional from the -b 
option.  If netperf was not ./configured with --enable-burst then a warning 
message should have been emitted.

Also, I am guessing you wanted TCP_NODELAY set, and that is -D but not a global 
-D.  I'm reasonably confident the -m 200 will have been ignored, but it would be 
best to drop it. So, I think your second line needs to be:

netperf.omni -p 12866 -c -C -H  172.17.60.216 -t omni -j -v 2 -b 1 -w 200 -- -r 
1 -d rr -k foo -D

If you want the request and response sizes to be 200 bytes, use -r 200 
(test-specific).

Also, if you ./configure with --enable-omni first, that netserver will 
understand both omni and non-omni tests at the same time and you don't have to 
have a second netserver on a different control port.  You can also go-in to 
config.h after the ./configure and unset WANT_MIGRATION and then UDP_STREAM in 
netperf will be the "true" classic UDP_STREAM code rather than the migrated to 
omni path.

As the -k file parsing option didn't care until recently (within the hour or 
so), I think it didn't matter that you had more than four lines (assuming that 
is a verbatim cat of foo).  However, if you pull the *current* top of trunk, it 
will probably start to care - I'm in the midst of adding support for "direct 
output selection" in the -k, -o and -O options and also cleaning-up the omni 
printing code to the point where there is only the one routing parsing the 
output selection file.  Currently that is the one for "human" output, which has 
a four line restriction.  I will try to make it smarter as I go.

happy benchmarking,
