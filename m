This ony works sometimes.  For example it's common to pin netperf to a
cpu to get consistent performance.  Proper hardware must obey what
applications want it to do, not the other way around.

I think you missed this:

	Some network interfaces can help with the distribution of incoming
	packets; they have multiple receive queues and multiple interrupt lines.
	Others, though, are equipped with a single queue, meaning that the
	driver for that hardware must deal with all incoming packets in a
	single, serialized stream. Parallelizing such a stream requires some
	intelligence on the part of the host operating system. 

In other words RPS is a hack to speed up networking on cheapo
hardware, this is one of the reasons it is off by default.
Good hardware has multiple receive queues.
We can implement a good one so we do not need RPS.

Also not all guest OS-es support RPS.

Does this clarify?

To avoid packet reordering by device (which generally leads to performance degradation) driver should attempt to utilize the same transmit virtqueue for all packets of a given transmit flow. For bi-directional protocols (in practice, TCP), a given network connection can utilize both transmit and receive queues. For best performance, packets from a single connection should utilize the paired transmit and receive queues from the same virtqueue pair; for example both transmitqN and receiveqN. This rule makes it possible to optimize processing on the device side, but this is not a hard requirement: devices should function correctly even when this rule i
 s not followed.

When rule is set to VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_STEERING_SINGLE (this is the default) all packets are steered to the default virtqueue transmitq (1); param is unused; this is the default. With any other rule, When rule is set to VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_STEERING_RX_FOLLOWS_TX packets are steered by driver to the first N=(param+1) multiqueue virtqueues transmitq1...transmitqN; the default transmitq is unused. Driver must have configured all these (param+1) virtqueues beforehand.

As selecting a specific steering is an optimization feature, drivers should avoid hard failure and fall back on using a supported steering rule if this command fails. The default steering rule is VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_STEERING_SINGLE. It will not be removed.

Since drivers might choose to modify the current steering rule at a high rate (e.g. adaptively in response to changes in the workload) to avoid reordering packets, device is recommended to complete processing of the transmit queue(s) utilized by the original steering before processing any packets delivered by the modified steering rule.

Driver controls which virtqueue is selected in practice by configuring packet steering rule using VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_STEERING command, as described above[sub:Transmit-Packet-Steering].

When rule is set to VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_STEERING_SINGLE all packets are steered to the default virtqueue receiveq (0); param is unused; this is the default. When rule is set to VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_STEERING_RX_FOLLOWS_TX packets are steered by host to the first N=(param+1) multiqueue virtqueues receiveq1...receiveqN; the default receiveq is unused. Driver must have configured all these (param+1) virtqueues beforehand. For best performance for bi-directional flows (such as TCP) device should detect the flow to virtqueue pair mapping on transmit and select the receive virtqueue from the same virtqueue pair. For uni-directional flows,
  or when this mapping information is missing, a device-specific steering function is used.

Device is not required to wait for these packets to be consumed before delivering packets using the new streering rule. Drivers modifying the steering rule at a high rate (e.g. adaptively in response to changes in the workload) are recommended to complete processing of the receive queue(s) utilized by the original steering before processing any packets delivered by the modified steering rule.
