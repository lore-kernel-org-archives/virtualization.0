I get the point and that's why you still want ipv6 offload helpers to
accept SKB_GSO_UDP. So SKB_GSO_UDP was still ambigious since it can be a
UDP6 packet in fact.

I'm not sure, but probably we could just leave the regression of legacy
guest as is and fix current kernel. The sooner we eliminate the 
ambigious
the better for future development.
