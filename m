What do you call "hinting ends" though? The fact we put
a page in the VQ is not a guarantee that it's been consumed
by the hypervisor.


I think a strict definition is this:
- hint includes a command ID
- hint implies "page was unused at some point after guest reading command I=
D"


Hypervisor can use dirty tracking tricks to get from that to
"page is unused at the moment".

Now we are talking about what's safe to do with the page.

If POISON flag is set by hypervisor but clear by guest,
or poison_val is 0, then it's clear it's safe to blow
away the page if we can figure out it's unused.

Otherwise, it's much less clear :)



I'll have to come back and re-read the rest next week, this
is complex stuff and I'm too rushed with other things today.
