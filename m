I apologize. I should have done better.

This patch fixes the following bug. Defio would cause a hang on write
access to the framebuffer as the page fault would be called
ad-infinitum. It fixes fb_defio by setting the mapping to be used by
page_mkclean.

Understood. The root cause of my flaw was my assumption that other
than me, there weren't any users of defio so I was in no hurry to get
it fixed.

Understood. It won't happen again.
