Perhaps Documentation/memory-barriers.txt needs additional clarification.
It would not be the first time.

If your CPU implicitly maintains ordering based on address and
data dependencies, then you don't need any instructions for
<data dependency barrier>.

The WRC+addr+addr is OK because data dependencies are not required to be
transitive, in other words, they are not required to flow from one CPU to
another without the help of an explicit memory barrier.  Transitivity is
instead supplied by smp_mb() and by smp_store_release()-smp_load_acquire()
chains.  Here is the Linux kernel code for WRC+addr+addr, give or take
(and no, I have no idea why anyone would want to write code like this):

	struct foo {
		struct foo **a;
	};
	struct foo b;
	struct foo c;
	struct foo d;
	struct foo e;
	struct foo f = { &d };
	struct foo g = { &e };
	struct foo *x = &b;

	void cpu0(void)
	{
		WRITE_ONCE(x, &f);
	}

	void cpu1(void)
	{
		struct foo *p;

		p = lockless_dereference(x);
		WRITE_ONCE(p->a, &x);
	}

	void cpu2(void)
	{
		r1 = lockless_dereference(f.a);
		WRITE_ONCE(*r1, &c);
	}

It is legal to end the run with x==&f and r1==&x.  To prevent this outcome,
we do the following:

	struct foo {
		struct foo **a;
	};
	struct foo b;
	struct foo c;
	struct foo d;
	struct foo e;
	struct foo f = { &d };
	struct foo g = { &e };
	struct foo *x = &b;

	void cpu0(void)
	{
		WRITE_ONCE(x, &f);
	}

	void cpu1(void)
	{
		struct foo *p;

		p = lockless_dereference(x);
		smp_store_release(&p->a, &x); /* Additional ordering. */
	}

	void cpu2(void)
	{
		r1 = lockless_dereference(f.a);
		WRITE_ONCE(*r1, &c);
	}

And I still don't know why anyone would need this sort of code.  ;-)

Alternatively, we pull cpu2() into cpu1():

	struct foo {
		struct foo **a;
	};
	struct foo b;
	struct foo c;
	struct foo d;
	struct foo e;
	struct foo f = { &d };
	struct foo g = { &e };
	struct foo *x = &b;

	void cpu0(void)
	{
		WRITE_ONCE(x, &f);
	}

	void cpu1(void)
	{
		struct foo *p;

		p = lockless_dereference(x);
		WRITE_ONCE(p->a, &x);
		r1 = lockless_dereference(f.a);
		WRITE_ONCE(*r1, &c);
	}

The ordering is now enforced by being within a single thread.  In fact,
the second lockless_dereference() can be READ_ONCE().

So, does MIPS maintain ordering within a given CPU based on address and
data dependencies?  If so, you don't need to emit memory-barrier instructions
for read_barrier_depends().

							Thanx, Paul
