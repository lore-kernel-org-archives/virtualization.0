If newer specs add more structures at the end of the config space, and
use the same config space for legacy, that space now becomes device
specific config space and not new-shiny-feature space, so we must
remember to handle those cases.

KVM tool actually has support for 64bit features, we can probably remove
that when Pekka isn't looking :)

The device initialization sequence might use an update as well. Maybe
also a description of how device handles missing structure IDs.

Just a note, these tables are way too wide to work properly in PDFs :)

I'm not sure what capability length is, can't find it in the spec
either.

Is it still true? We're talking about the new layout here (there are
several of this footnote, this one is located right *before* the section
which talks about legacy config space.

The bit numbers below this text should be corrected as well.
