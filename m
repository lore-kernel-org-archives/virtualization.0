If two tasks see the pending bit goes away and try to grab it with 
cmpxchg, there is no way we can avoid the contention. However, if some 
how the pending bit holder get the lock and another task set the pending 
bit before the current task, the spinlock value will become 
_Q_PENDING_VAL|_Q_LOCKED_VAL. The while loop will end and the code will 
blindly try to do a cmpxchg unless we check for this case before hand. 
This is what my code does by going back to the beginning of the for loop.
