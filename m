Hi all:

This series is an update version of multiqueue virtio-net driver based on
Krishna Kumar's work to let virtio-net use multiple rx/tx queues to do the
packets reception and transmission. Please review and comments.

Changes from v5:
- Align the implementation with the RFC spec update v4
- Switch the mode between single mode and multiqueue mode without reset
- Remove the 256 limitation of queues
- Use helpers to do the mapping between virtqueues and tx/rx queues
- Use commbined channels instead of separated rx/tx queus when do the queue
number configuartion
- Other coding style comments from Michael

Reference:
- A protype implementation of qemu-kvm support could by found in
git://github.com/jasowang/qemu-kvm-mq.git
- V5 could be found at http://lwn.net/Articles/505388/
- V4 could be found at https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/6/25/120
- V2 could be found at http://lwn.net/Articles/467283/
- Michael virtio-spec: http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg209986.html

Perf Numbers:

- Pktgen test shows the receiving capability of the multiqueue virtio-net were
  dramatically improved.
- Netperf result shows latency were greately improved according to the test
result. The throughput were kept or improved when transfter with large
packets. But we get regression with small packet (<1500)
transmission/receiving. According to the satistics, TCP tends batch less when mq
is enabled which means much more but smaller pakcets were sent/received whcih
lead much higher cpu utilization and degradate the throughput. In the future,
either tuning of TCP or automatic switch bettwen mq and sq is needed.

Test environment:
- Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5620 @ 2.40GHz, 8 cores 2 numa nodes
- Two directed connected 82599
- Host/Guest kenrel: net-next with the mq virtio-net patches and mq tuntap
patches

Pktgen test:
- Local host generate 64 byte UDP packet to guest.
- average of 20 runs
