XDP isn't the blocker here. As far as I am concerned we can go either
way, with a 2 netdev or a 3 netdev solution. We just need to make sure
we are aware of all the trade-offs, and make a decision one way or the
other. This is quickly turning into a bikeshed and I would prefer us
to all agree, or at least disagree and commit, on which way to go
before we burn more cycles on a patch set that seems to be getting
tied up in debate.

With the 2 netdev solution we have to limit the functionality so that
we don't break things when we bypass the guts of the driver to hand
traffic off to the VF. Then ends up meaning that we are stuck with an
extra qdisc and Tx queue lock in the transmit path of the VF, and we
cannot rely on any in-driver Rx functionality to work such as
in-driver XDP. However the advantage here is that this is how netvsc
is already doing things.

The issue with the 3 netdev solution is that you are stuck with 2
netdevs ("ens1", "ens1nbackup") when the VF is not present. It could
be argued this isn't a very elegant looking solution, especially when
the VF is not present. With virtio this makes more sense though as you
are still able to expose the full functionality of the lower device so
you don't have to strip or drop any of the existing net device ops if
the "backup" bit is present.

Ultimately I would have preferred to have the 3 netdev solution go
with virtio only as it would have allowed for healthy competition
between the two designs and we could have seen which one would have
ultimately won out, but if we have to decide this now we need to do so
before we put too much more effort into the patches as these end up
becoming two very different solutions, especially if we have to apply
the solution to both drivers. My preference would still be 3 netdevs
since we could apply this to netvsc without too many changes, but I
will agree with whatever conclusion we can come to in terms of how
this is supposed to work for both netvsc and virtio_bypass.
