Queued for v2.

I modified vring_use_dma_api to take a vring_virtqueue* parameter to
make this easier.

I'm a bit torn here.  I want to get the mechanism and the Xen part in,
and there's unlikely to be much debate on those as a matter of
principle.  I'd also like to flip as many arches over as possible, but
that could be trickier.  Let me mull over this.
