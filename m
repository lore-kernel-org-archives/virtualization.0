The virtio PMD (drivers/net/virtio) in DPDK doesn't need to share
the virtio ring operation code with other drivers and is highly
optimized for network. E.g. in Rx, the Rx burst function won't
chain descs. So the ID management for the Rx ring can be quite
simple and straightforward, we just need to initialize these IDs
when initializing the ring and don't need to change these IDs
in data path anymore (the mergable Rx code in that patch set
assumes the descs will be written back in order, which should be
fixed. I.e., the ID in the desc should be used to index vq->descx[]).
The Tx code in that patch set also assumes the descs will be
written back by device in order, which should be fixed.

But in kernel virtio driver, the virtio_ring.c is very generic.
The enqueue (virtqueue_add()) and dequeue (virtqueue_get_buf_ctx())
functions need to support all the virtio devices and should be
able to handle all the possible cases that may happen. So although
the packed ring can be very efficient in some cases, currently
the room to optimize the performance in kernel's virtio_ring.c
isn't that much. If we want to take the fully advantage of the
packed ring's efficiency, we need some further e.g. API changes
in virtio_ring.c, which shouldn't be part of this patch set. So
I still think this patch set is mainly to make the kernel virtio
driver to have a full functional support of the packed ring, and
we can't expect impressive performance boost with it.
