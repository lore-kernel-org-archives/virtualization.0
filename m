Is it the overhead of creating them or just allocating the pages?

The logic you propose is basically add direct as long as
the ring is mostly empty. So if the problem is in allocations,
one simple optimization for this one workload is add a small
cache of memory to use for indirect bufs. Of course building
a good API for this is where we got blocked in the past...

One notes that this to some level conflicts with patches that change
virtio net not to drain the vq before add buf, in that we are
required here to drain the vq to avoid indirect.

Not necessarily a serious problem, but something to keep in mind:
a memory pool would not have this issue.

Is this with the kvm tool? what kind of benchmark is this?

Need to verify the effect on block too, and do some more
benchmarks. In particular we are making the ring
in effect smaller, how will this affect small packet perf
with multiple streams?


A very simple test is to disable indirect buffers altogether.
qemu-kvm has a flag for this.
Is this an equivalent test?
If yes I'll try that.

We can get rid of bool indirect now, just set indirect_threshold to 0,
right?

Please add a comment. It should be something like
'Min. number of free space in the ring to trigger direct descriptor use'

If num_free is 0, this will allocate the buffer which is
not a good idea.

I think there's a regression here: with a small vq, we could
previously put in an indirect descriptor, with your patch
add_buf will fail. I think this is a real problem for block
which was the original reason indirect bufs were introduced.

Let's add some defines at top of the file please, maybe even
a module parameter.
