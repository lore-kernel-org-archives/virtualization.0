I hope that I'm not thoroughly confused at this point in time, so I'll
summarize my current understanding (also keep in mind that I haven't
looked at Venu's patches yet):

- The Linux guest initiates coupling from the virtio-net driver.
  Matching the other device is done via the MAC, and only pci devices
  are allowed for the failover device. (There does not seem to be any
  restriction on the transport of the virtio-net device.)
- The Linux guest virtio-net driver does not allow changing the MAC if
  standby has been negotiated (implying that the hypervisor needs to
  configure the correct MAC).
- In QEMU, we need to know which two devices (vfio-pci and virtio-net)
  go together, so that the virtio-net device gets the correct MAC. We
  also need the pairing so that we can make the vfio-pci device
  available once the guest has negotiated the standby feature.

We can tack the two devices together in QEMU by introducing new,
optional properties pointing from the virtio-net device to the vfio-pci
device (only offer standby if this is set) and the other way around
(don't make the device visible at the start if this is set). Problems:

- The admin needs to figure out the MAC by themselves and set it
  correctly. If this is incorrect, the vfio-pci device cannot be found
  in the guest. (Not sure how much of a problem this is in practice --
  and QEMU cannot figure out the MAC without poking at the vfio-pci
  device, and we probably want to avoid that.)
- This two-way pointing makes for interesting handing of the command
  line and when both devices are plugged later.

In any case, I'm not sure anymore why we'd want the extra uuid. Is
there any way QEMU (or libvirt) can figure it out without actually
looking at the vfio-pci device?
