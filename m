These examples are due to exhaustion of the fixed ubuf_info pool,
right? We could use dynamic allocation or a resizable pool if these
issues are serious enough.

Yes, that is what I meant.

That assumes that guests are fragile in this regard. A linux guest
does not make such assumptions. There are NICs with hardware
rate limiting, so I'm not sure how much of a leap host os rate
limiting is.
