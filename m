Right! That's the obvious one.

Hm, to maintain the current behaviour of poll() returning some
poll_mask, the poll_mask could be made into an atomic variable with
khvcd() updating it. But to have read at a higher priority than the
other stuff, I don't quite see yet how that can be done.

The other routines are open(), close(), write(), etc., and other kernel
context (hvc_instantiate() and the khvcd thread).

Yes.

Thanks for the response!
