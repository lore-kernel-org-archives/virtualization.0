Here's the general order:
- 1 week before Linus merge window: I stop putting new stuff into xxx-next.
- Linus merge window open: I push stuff to Linus, new stuff stays in -pending.
- Linus merge window close: I ff my -next trees to -rc1, merge stuff
  from -pending.

In this case, your patch will go from pending-rebases to DaveM, not
virtio-next.

Which I will do now...

Cheers,
Rusty.
