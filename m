Michael,
        Nothing formal. I did some TCP single-stream throughput tests
and was seeing 20-25% improvement on a laptop (ie, low-end hardware).
That actually surprised me; I'd think it'd be about the same, except
maybe in a test that has mixed packet sizes. Comparisons with the
net-next kernel these patches are for showed only ~10% improvement.
        But I also see a lot of variability both among different
configurations and with the same configuration on different runs.
So, I don't feel like those numbers are very solid, and I haven't
yet done any tests on bigger hardware.

2 notes: I have a modified version of qemu to get the VHOST_FEATURES
flags, including the mergeable RX bufs flag, passed to the guest; I'll
be working with your current qemu git trees next, if any changes are
needed to support it there.
        Second, I've found a missing initialization in the patches I
sent on the list, so I'll send an updated patch 2 with the fix, and
qemu patches when they are ready (plus any code-review comments
incorporated).

                                                                +-DLS
