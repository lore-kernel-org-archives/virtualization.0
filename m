Thank you for adding topics to discuss.

Of course we could disucss anywhere anytime.  I think Access/Contituity-aware
Memory Autoscaling (ACMA) could be just a parallel project.  It doens't need to
be an extension of, or blocked by "beyond-page table access bit" project, in my
humble opinion.

ACMA is still on my TODO list.  It is mainly a matter of prioritization.  As it
becomes clear it requires more attention, I could allocate more time for the
project.  There was a user showing interest recently.  I'm planning to
prioritize it more.  If DeepSeek could confirm their interest, it could help me
prioritizing it further.

As always, coding may not be that difficult and take that long time.  Testing
might be the biggest challenge.  I don't have good test infrastructure now.
Actually the lack of good test infrastructure is one of my biggest DAMON
maintenance concerns nowadays.  Others' help on testing or test infra would be
super helpful.

If someone wants to implement and contribute it based on the proposed idea, it
would also be nice.

Sounds great.  That would be super productive collaborations.

We could keep discussing in mailing list, but of course in person discussions
are always helpful.  I'm eagerly looking forward to the next week :)

Appreciate your continued and grateful contributions, Lian.
