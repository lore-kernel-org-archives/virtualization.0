I think it was a bit of misspeak/misread specifically I am thinking of:
  You don't need 2 images. You need only one. The one with the
  team setup. That's it. If another netdev with the same mac appears,
  teamd will enslave it and run traffic on it. If not, ok, you'll go only
  through virtio_net.

I read that as there being no team if the VF wasn't present since you
would still be going through team and then virtio_net otherwise.

The problem is for us option 2 is quite a bit uglier. Basically it
means essentially telling all the distros and such that their cloud
images have to use team by default on all virtio_net interfaces. It
pretty much means we have to throw away this as a possible solution
since you are requiring guest changes that most customers/OS vendors
would ever accept.

At least with our solution it was the driver making use of the
functionality if a given feature bit was set. The teaming solution as
proposed doesn't even give us that option.

Right. Basically we need to have the renaming occur so that any
existing config gets moved to the upper interface instead of having to
rely on configuration being adjusted for the team interface.

It is more the logistical nightmare. Part of the goal here was to work
with the cloud base images that are out there such as
https://alt.fedoraproject.org/cloud/. With just the kernel changes the
overhead for this stays fairly small and would be pulled in as just a
standard part of the kernel update process. The virtio bypass only
pops up if the backup bit is present. With the team solution it
requires that the base image use the team driver on virtio_net when it
sees one. I doubt the OSVs would want to do that just because SR-IOV
isn't that popular of a case.

The signaling isn't too much of an issue since we can just tweak the
link state of the VF or virtio manually to report the link up or down
prior to the hot-plug. Now that we are on the same page with the team0
interface always being there, I don't think 3 is much of a concern
with the solution as you proposed.
