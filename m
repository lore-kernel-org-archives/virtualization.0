RX following TX is logic of flow director I believe.  {a}RFS has RX
follow CPU where application receive is done on the socket.  So in RFS
there is no requirement to have a 1-1 correspondence between TX and RX
queues, and in fact this allows different number of queues between TX
and RX.  We found this necessary when using priority HW queues, so
that there are more TX queues than RX.

AFAIK ooo RX is still possible with accelerated RFS.  We have an
algorithm that prevents this for RFS by deferring a migration to a new
queue as long as it's possible that a flow might have outstanding
packets on the old queue.  I suppose this could be implemented in the
device for the HW queues, but I don't think it would be easy to cover
all cases where packets were already in transit to the host or other
cases where host and device queues are out of sync.
