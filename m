Sure, vbus is more flexible here.

There's virtio-console, virtio-blk etc.  None of these have kernel-mode 
servers, but these could be implemented if/when needed.

You mean multilink?  You expose the device as a multiqueue.

pci (for kvm/x86).

That will make qemu integration easier.

I think vhost-net is separated into vhost and vhost-net.

Yes.  virtio is really virtualization oriented.

vhost by design leaves configuration and handshaking to userspace.  I 
see it as an advantage.
