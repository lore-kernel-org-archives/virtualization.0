Hello David,

Can you recommend an approach for e.g. the qib driver 
(drivers/infiniband/hw/qib)? That driver uses the CPU (PIO) instead of 
DMA to transfer data to a PCIe device. Sorry but I don't see how 
per-device IOMMU ops would allow to avoid that e.g. a cache flush is 
triggered before PIO starts.

Bart.
