OK. So looks like you think it's okay to include PCI specific concept
but not the data? Like a feature indicating the virtio device is
behind a (external) PCI bridge, and perhaps also includes the data
present in the PCI bridge/function's capability?

Sorry for asking tough questions. I still need to understand and
digest the boundary of this layering thing.

I'm afraid it's a loose end. The real thing is there's no way to
indicate VF or passthrough device on Linux, even true on some other
OS. There's no such flag exists yet. Even the emulated e1000 and
rltk8139 device looks the same as PCI device. And as part of the
requirements of being a spec, the behaviour and expectation need to be
precisely described for implementations to follow. There's no point to
assume just one OS will implement this feature so it needs to depend
on specifics of that OS.

True, but it breaks people's expectation that it has to rely on MAC
address being unique when turning it on for live migration, and once
it happens some configs with same MAC address would break (for e.g.
bonding setup can have it for cross subnet failover and site
replication). Unless this limitation is clearly documented in the spec
I don't think people will notice that until it breaks.

Well this condition is absolutely neccessary but not sufficient. There
should be some other unique key to help find the NIC as the MAC cannot
be unique as what people generally thought it be.

Well there are precedents that people thought something broken but
soon find out users already depends on the "broken" behaviour.
Nowadays widely use of virtualization technology make MAC address
duplication really cheap. It's not that uncommon as one might think.

Unless the expectation can be explicitly documented in the spec, I
don't feel it's something users can easily infer from what the new
feature should target - live migration.

Glad you'd have to admit that there's no better way *without
introducing complex PCI bridge setup* in the KVM, oops, QEMU without
KVM? err, QEMU with KVM world.

I'm sorry, I don't understand why this should not be part of the
failover discussion.

There's a lot of ambiguity about the semantics and the expectation of
the _F_STANDBY feature, and that should be recorded in virtio-dev. If
you think we should run it with a different thread, I can definitely
fork a new thread to continue.

As you may wonder, the other aspects unclear to me now are:
- does this feature imply the device model already? The 3-netdev?
- should clear the feature bit upon unsuccessful creation of the
failover interface or failure to enslave the VF?
- does the feature bit indicate migratability status for the
corresponding VF/PT device?
- does the feature expect automatic bonding by default or always?
- does the guest user have the freedom to disable/re-enable the
automatic bonding? such that they can use raw VF for DPDK or RDMA
after the migration
- ...

I hope the answer won't just be to look at what the current
implementation is doing. The discussion will be helpful, at least not
harmful, for people to understand the intention and definition
clearly, since live migration itself is just too complicated.

I'm confused. Isn't the NUMA and IOMMU disposition host admin should
explicitly define? In that case it's assumed that s/he understand the
implication and the bus address doesn't restrict the host admin from
placing the device according to the NUMA or IOMMU
consideration/constrait.

If the virtio has to be behind a different bridge thus IOMMU domain
than that for VF (which does not actually need a guest IOMMU) then
your former proposal of grouping them *under the same bridge* would
come across hurtles.

An external PCI bridge? This gets back to the first question I ask.
It's interesting a virtio feature should reference an externel object
which seems more like a layering problem at least to me.

>   - include a bridge internally
This internal one being a native PCI bridge or VirtIO PCI bridge? I'm
almost cerntain it should be the latter down the road. That determines
where the VPD or SN capability should reside.

Good. Decouple the concept of grouping to rely on same PCI bridge, and
another bridge with same UUID seems more flexible and promissing.

I'd think anway VirtIO spec revision is unavoidable if you have to
involve PCI bridge. Not so complicated?
