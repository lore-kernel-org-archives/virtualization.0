Migration does not break.

Since I wrote this code in qemu let me explain what is going on.

qemu requires that local and remote side are started with
same feature bits.
To support cross version migration, code in hw/pc_piix.c
disables features if you require migration from/to old qemu.

At some point I added a sanity check:
if we get guest features we know that any bit
set there must be set in host features.
Yes, this catches some user mistakes.

This was never intended as a compatibility guarantee.
User is still required to start qemu such
that host features match exactly, anything else
can lead to failures some of them hard to debug.

Here is a simple example:

1. guest reads host features
2. guest is migrated - check passes since no features are acked
3. guest acks features -> failure

This applies to any feature. Nothing special with this one.

Yes, we can if we want to make this more robust
against user errors, e.g. by migrating host feature
bits. Patches welcome. If we do it will help all
features, not just this one.

It is not buggy. It does not ack MUST_TELL_HOST. So it is free to tell
host at any point, it behaves exactly
to spec. You can not retroactively declare drivers buggy like that.

The right thing to do is either
4. realize we can not address all user errors, so no real issue
5. address this class of user errors by migrating host features

I am not happy.
We lose compatibility with all existing drivers
so it will take years until the feature is actually
useful.

Is this just a matter of naming? Same functionality:
driver that acks this bit will tell host first,
driver that does not will not?

If yes that is fine.
