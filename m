Well, without any accounting at all you could use quite a lot of memory as =

I doubt that.  There'll be some cache friendliness, but I'm not sure it'll =

I couldn't see any difference in saturation here (with default scheduler an=
d an =

100MBit e1000e).  Two reasons come to mind: firstly, only the hardware queu=
e is =

unregulated: the tx queue is still accounted.  And when you add scheduling =

the mix, I can't in practice cause starvation of other senders.

Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
