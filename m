It doesn't seem like this is usable to implement accelerated RFS in the
guest, though perhaps that doesn't matter.  On the host side, presumably
you'll want vhost_net to do the equivalent of sock_rps_record_flow() -
only without a socket?  But in any case, that requires an rxhash, so I
don't see how this is supposed to work.
