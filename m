CPU where application receive is done on the socket.  So in RFS there is no
requirement to have a 1-1 correspondence between TX and RX queues, and in
fact this allows different number of queues between TX and RX.  We found
this necessary when using priority HW queues, so that there are more TX
queues than RX.

Perhaps Tom can explain how we avoid out-of-order receive for the

prevents this for RFS case by deferring a migration to a new queue as long
as it's possible that a flow might have outstanding packets on the old
queue.  I suppose this could be implemented in the device for the HW
queues, but I don't think it would be easy to cover all cases where packets
were already in transit to the host or other cases where host and device
queues are out of sync.
