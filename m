(adding Xin Xiaohui to the conversation for comment)

According to the NetworkingTodo page on the KVM wiki, zero-copy RX for 
macvtap is in fact on the roadmap, assigned to Xin:

http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/NetworkingTodo

The Release Notes for RHEL 6.2 (originally published on 12/06/2011) also 
specifically mention macvtap/vhost zero-copy capabilities as being 
included as a Technology Preview:

http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/6.2_Release_Notes/virtualization.html

Since I've been unable to find much information on the current status of 
this development, can anyone confirm if this functionality is still in 
the works? If so, is there any planned ETA?

Thanks,
Robert Vineyard
