Since this has no effect on virtio, isn't presenting
"no supported modes" to user the right thing to do?

I think you might want to special-case no supported modes.
Special-casing virtio is probably best avoided.

I think that's the right approach. So if driver does not present
any supported modes this probably means it is not necessary
to display or program any.
