I've considered this idea, and as a matter a fact would be my preferred
solution. It would be, if we could use GFP_DMA when allocating coherent
memory through the DMA API. For CCW devices we *must* have some of the
device accessible memory 31 bit addressable (in physical address space),
because the s390 architecture *mandates it*. I had patches
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/9/23/313) that do that but Christoph was not
open to the idea.

Always pushing all the stuff allocated by virtio devices into the DMA
zone is not a good option for us. We did that for protected guests,
because that was what Christoph was willing to accept, but not happy
with it.

I'm willing to go down that rute, but I really need the capability to
tell the DMA API 'do this allocation from ZONE_DMA'. I don't care how.

I agree.

>=20

IMHO one could make the DMA API work with different DMA ops. The
virtio transport or the virtio core can probably intervene. But then, we
(virtio-ccw) would need the iommu=3Doff DMA ops to do the bounce buffering
iff force_dma_unencrypted().
