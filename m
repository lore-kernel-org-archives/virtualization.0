Maybe that help text could be slightly more verbose? Like "This is only
necessary if you plan to run this kernel as a guest on Microsoft Hyper-V"?
And I would welcome the usual "the module will be called" text for this
driver, too. See the first 2 lines of context of think hunk for a
copy&paste source of this text.
