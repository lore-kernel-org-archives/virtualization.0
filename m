I did that too. This is to cover the case where somebody is running
the code prior to my QEMU changes where the page poison feature wasn't
being enabled.

I agree, but at the same time the way the feature was originally coded
it was only checked if the FREE_PAGE_HINT feature was enabled. The
assumption there is that if we have page poison data and want to use
hints we need to report it. In my mind if we ever want to switch over
to the page reporting style setup for page hinting in the future we
will need to have it behave in a sane manner. So disabling it if we
have a poison value we need to report, but have no mechanism to report
it makes sense to me.

The actual likelihood of us encountering this case should be pretty
low anyway since it is not that common to have page poisoning or
init_on_free enabled.

The problem is we cannot communicate the full situation to the
hypervisor without the page poison feature being present. As such I
would worry about that backfiring on us due to the hypervisor acting
on incomplete data.
