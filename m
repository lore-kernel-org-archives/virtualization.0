It wouldn't if we were creating virtio from scratch.

However we have to be realistic here, we are contending with existing
practices and implementation. The fact is qemu *does* bypass any iommu
and has been doing so for a long time, *and* the guest drivers are
written today *also* bypassing all DMA mapping mechanisms and just
passing everything accross.

So if it's a bug, it's a bug on both sides of the fence. We are no
longer in "bug fixing" territory here, it's a fundamental change of ABI.
The ABI might not be what was intended (but that's arguable, see below),
but it is that way.

Arguably it was even known and considered a *feature* by some (including
myself) at the time. It somewhat improved performances on archs where
otherwise every page would have to be mapped/unmapped in guest iommu. In
fact, it also makes vhost a lot easier.

So I disagree, it's de-facto a feature (even if unintended) of the
existing virtio implementations and changing that would be a major
interface change, and thus should be exposed as such.

Except that it's not so easy.

For example, on PPC PAPR guests, there is no such thing as a "no IOMMU"
space, the concept doesn't exist. So we have at least three things to
deal with:

 - Existing guests, so we must preserve the existing behaviour for
backward compatibility.

 - vhost is made more complex because it now needs to be informed of the
guest iommu updates

 - New guests have the "new driver" that knows how to map and unmap
would have a performance loss unless some mechanism to create a "no
iommu" space exists which for us would need to be added. Either that or
we rely on DDW which is a way for a guest to create a permanent mapping
of its entire address space in an IOMMU but that incur a significant
waste of host kernel memory.

No because we can mix and match virtio and other devices on the same
host bridge. Unless we put a property that only applies to virtio
children of the host bridge.
