Thanks. I plan to add

TODO: The current implementation could be further improved by stopping the reporting when the vq is full and continuing the reporting when host notifies that there are available entries for the driver to add.

OK. I plan to change 1  to -EBUSY to indicate the case that host actively asks the driver to stop reporting (This makes the callback return value type consistent with walk_free_mem_block).

I'm afraid the driver couldn't be aware if the added hints are stale or not, because host and guest actions happen asynchronously. That is, host side iothread stops taking hints as soon as the migration thread asks to stop, it doesn't wait for any ACK from the driver to stop (as we discussed before, host couldn't always assume that the driver is in a responsive state).

Btw, we also don't need to worry about any memory left in the vq, since only addresses are added to the vq, there is no real memory allocations.

Best,
Wei
