Xen can deal either way, but tickless is certainly preferred.

Yep.  We'll need to come up with a common story for that.

Xen has a nanosecond resolution one-shot timer which I'm using for
this.  There's also a 100Hz tick which gets in the way a bit (it will
appear as a stream of spurious timeouts), but we'll turn that off soon.

I'm not sure how much different it makes overall.  It's true that
absolute time would be a more useful interface, but because the guest
vcpu can be preempted at any time, we could miss the timeout
regardless.  In Xen if you set a timeout for the past you get an
immediate interrupt; I presume the clockevent code can deal with that?
