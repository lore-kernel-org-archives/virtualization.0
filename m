Hi Arnd, I have another question is some drivers will request more than one
MSI/MSI-X IRQ, and the driver will use them to process different things.
Eg. network driver generally uses one of them to process trivial network thins,
and others to transmit/receive data.

So, in this case, it seems to driver need to touch the IRQ numbers.
