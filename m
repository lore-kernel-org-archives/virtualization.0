Hi Anthony,

Thank you for your suggestion. I tried commenting out the calling
aio_init(), the AIO functions use aio_threads=20 and aio_num=64 as
default, but the results were the same as I have tested before, the
number of I/Os was divided into equal proportion.

Then, I changed "io_throttle" value to 1(default is 4). "io_throttle"
is a dm-ioband's configuration parameter, when the number of BIOs in
progress exceeds this value, dm-ioband starts to control the bandwidth. 
And then the bandwidth control seemed to work much better, but sometimes
I wasn't able to get the proper proportions. As these results indicate,
the number of simultaneous I/O requests issued from two KVM virtual
machines was less than 4.

     The number of issued I/Os for 60 seconds (io_throttle = 1)

That's good idea. I hope your work is going well and look forward to
releasing the patches.
