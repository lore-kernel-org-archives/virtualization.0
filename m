Thanks, fixed.

An excellent question, but I thought the modern kernel etiquette was to only 
comment on whitespace and formatting, and call it "review"? :)

Yes, kinda-sorta in that it's a ring buffer.  No, in that it's bidir and 
consumption can be out-of-order (kind of important for I/O buffers).

But the reason I'm not proposing it as a syscall is that I'm not convinced 
it's the One True Solution which everyone should be using.  Time will tell: 
it's clearly not tied to tun and it's been generically useful for virtual 
I/O, but history has not been kind to new userspace interfaces.

Snot from previous version.  Removed.

Yes, except I like the clarity and the BUG_ON.

"#include <copyright-gpl2-plus>" for me, just to add more inclement weather to 
that teacup...

Thanks,
Rusty.
