Well, yes and no ... ppc will be able to do that too, it's just
pointless and will suck performances.

Additionally, it will be incompatible with existing guests since
today, the guest assumes physical (doesn't use the dma mapping
routines), so even if x86 grows the ability to have virtio behind an
iommu in qemu, that will break existing guests.

Either that or we have a capability that can be negociated.

There are other reasons for wanting to allow the use of the DMA ops,
such as people using virtio as a transport between two physically
connected machines (such as a CPU running a PCIe endpoint to a CPU
running a PCIe host, or two hosts connected to a non-transparent switch,
essentially using PCIe as a fast network fabric).

Cheers,
Ben.
