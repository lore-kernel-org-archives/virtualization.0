It is possible if you should only care about dm-ioband.

I just thought the approach that every cgroup should also have its own
io_iocontext was more generic, since both types of io_contexts represent
the contexts of issuers so I think it will be good if these can be
handled in the same way. I think it will make it easier for other
functionalities of the kernel to use this feature.

But we may have to think it over again if it has become clear that
this approach costs a lot.

Thanks
Hirokazu Takahashi.
