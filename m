I do not think this is a good idea -- the problems with unfair locks are
worse in a virtualized guest.  If a waiting VCPU deschedules and has to
be kicked to grab a lock then it is very likely to lose a race with
another running VCPU trying to take a lock (since it takes time for the
VCPU to be rescheduled).

Are these figures with or without the later PV support patches?
