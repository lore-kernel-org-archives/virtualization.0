If that is the case.  In the normal kernel what would
the "the oops, we got an interrupt code do?"
I assume it would leave interrupts disabled when it returns?
Like we currently do with the delayed disable of normal interrupts?

I'm trying to understand the proposed semantics.

Looking at the above code snippet.  I guess it is about time to
merge our per_cpu and pda variables...
