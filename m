I run rr and stream test of netperf, and multiqueue shows improvement on 
rr test and regression on small packet transmission in stream test. For 
small packet transmission, multiqueue tends to send much more small 
packets which also increase the cpu utilization. I suspect multiqueue is 
faster and tcp does not merger big enough packet to send, but may need 
more think.
