I don't keep my emails any more, but you *never* fixed the problems in =

arch/*/kernel/traps.c.

Yes, the kernel/unwind.c issues generally got fixed. The infinite loops in =

the *callers* never did.

Still in denial, I see.

Do you still claim that "the fallback position always did the right =

thing"? Despite the fact that the unwinder had sometimes *corrupted* the =

incoming information so much that the fallback position was the one that =

oopsed? And no, you didn't fix that.

And no, IT DID NOT use probe_kernel_address like you still claim.

Anyway, you work for Suse, I don't care what you do to the Suse kernel. =

Maybe it will get stable some day. Somehow, I doubt it. =
