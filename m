I trust you this was not the intent. But it seems to be
the intent in spec, because almost all features are optional.

And so windows driver authors interpreted it
this way. And it is *useful* like this.  See below.

Suggested use is for device assignment which needs all guest memory
locked.  hypervisor can unlock pages in balloon but guest must wait for
hypervisor to lock them back before use.

when a hypervisor implements this,
this will work with linux guests but not windows
guests and the existing bit fits exactly the purpose.

But we can add it in qemu and it will be a useful feature.

I think the issue is that kvm always locked all guest memory
for assignment. This restriction is removed
with vfio which has separate page tables.
Now that vfio is upstream and work on qemu integration
is being worked on, we might finally see people using this bit
to allow memory overcommit with device assignment.

So let's not remove yet, there is no rush.
Let's document it that this feature is optional,
maybe renaming as Paolo suggests.
