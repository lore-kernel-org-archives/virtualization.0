OK so it's preferable: will work on existing hypervisors.

There is no way in spec to break the guest.
You can not fail to offer virtqueues.
Besides, there is no guarantee that virtqueue setup
happens after feature negotiation.

I think I get what your proposed SILENT means what I do not get
is the motivation. It looks like a premature optimization to me.

The spec is pretty clear that if guest acks feature it
is a contract that dictates behaviour.
If it doesn't it is either ignored or just informative
depending on feature.

Block example is just informative. It does not need to be
negotiated even to be used.
But last example is wrong.
If you ack GUEST_ANNOUNCE hypervisor assumes guest will
announce self, if guest does not do it this break migration.

So it looks like we don't need a new bit to leak in atomic ctx.
Just do not ack MUST_TELL_HOST and delay telling host to a wq.
IMO we should not add random stuff to spec like this just because it
seems like a good idea.

OK so TELL says *when* to notify host, SILENT if set allows guest
to skip leak notifications? In this case TELL should just be ignored
when SILENT is set. Otherwise it's a reasonable extension.
But I am still not sure *why* do we need SILENT - any data showing
that avoiding these notifications is a win?
Let's not add new features until we see an actual use.

IMHO, renaming is fine since there is confusion.
But WILL_TELL is also not all that clear imho.

I think the confusion is that TELL_HOST seems to
imply we can avoid telling host at all.
How about being explicit?

VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_HOST_ACK_BEFORE_DEFLATE

Hmm?


"MUST" "WILL" are not really informative.

Also some confusion I think is from spec text saying "feature is set"
in many cases where it really almost always means "feature is negotiated".

Let's address?
