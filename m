There are two separate things here.  One is the scatter gather list
bounce buffer processing, which is a bit nasty, but if you want to use <
4kb block size filesystems, I suppose I have to accept that you need it
(although since it's a global fault of the hypervisor, perhaps it should
sit in the hypervisor interface layer, so that every SG based transport
can use it).  The other is the biovec merge function addition.  The
purpose of this function seems to be to ensure you get one SG entry for
every page (if I read it right)?  In that case, you don't need any of
this special casing.  The flag DISABLE_CLUSTERING achieves the same
thing.
