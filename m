But what makes you think that you can build code that can be linked
into arbitrary future kernel versions? The kernel does not define any
calling conventions that are stable across multiple versions or
configurations. For example, you'd have to provide different binaries
for each combination of

- 32/64 bit code
- gcc -mregparm=?
- lockdep
- tracepoints
- stackcheck
- NOMMU
- highmem
- whatever new gets merged

If you build the plugins only for specific versions of "enterprise" Linux
kernels, the code becomes really hard to debug and maintain.
If you wrap everything in your own version of the existing interfaces, your
code gets bloated to the point of being unmaintainable.

So I have to correct myself: this is very different from assuming the
driver is available in the guest, it's actually much worse.
