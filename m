Can you flesh out this trick?

On x86 IIUC the IOMMU more-or-less defaults to passthrough.  If the
kernel wants, it can switch it to a non-passthrough mode.  My patches
cause the virtio driver to do exactly this, except that the host
implementation doesn't actually exist yet, so the patches will instead
have no particular effect.

On powerpc and sparc, we *already* screwed up.  The host already tells
the guest that there's an IOMMU and that it's *enabled* because those
platforms don't have selective IOMMU coverage the way that x86 does.
So we need to work around it.

I think that, if we want fancy virt-friendly IOMMU stuff like you're
talking about, then the right thing to do is to create a virtio bus
instead of pretending to be PCI.  That bus could have a virtio IOMMU
and its own cross-platform enumeration mechanism for devices on the
bus, and everything would be peachy.

In the mean time, there are existing mechanisms by which every PCI
driver is supposed to notify the host/platform of how it intends to
map DMA memory, and virtio gets it wrong.

I still don't understand what trick.  If we want virtio devices to be
assignable, then they should be translated through the IOMMU, and the
DMA API is the right interface for that.

Can powerpc and sparc do exact 1:1 passthrough for a given device?  If
so, that might be a reasonable way forward.  After all, if a new
powerpc kernel asks for exact passthrough (dma addr = phys addr with
no offset at all), then old QEMU will just ignore it and therefore
accidentally get it right.  Ben?
