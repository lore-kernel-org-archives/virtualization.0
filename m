Yes, I think that can work. I will try to ran this patch to see how
thing goes.

That will be really nice too. I am not too fond of working in assembly.

In Red Hat, my focus will be on KVM performance. I do believe that there
are still Xen users out there. So we still need to keep their interest
into consideration. Given that, I am OK to make it work better in KVM
first and then think about Xen later.

Yes, I guess so. The noinline is there so that we know what the CPU time
is for spinning rather than other activities within the slowpath.
