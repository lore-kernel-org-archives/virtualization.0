Ugh ... not again. Ram, don't bring that subject back we ALREADY
addressed it, and requiring the *user* to do special things is just
utterly and completely wrong.

The *user* has no bloody idea what that stuff is, will never know to
set whatver magic qemu flag etc... The user will just start a a VM
normally and expect things to work. Requiring the *user* to know things
like that iommu virtio flag is complete nonsense.

If by "user" you mean libvirt, then you are now requesting about 4 or 5
different projects to be patched to add speical cases for something
they know nothing about and is completely irrelevant, while it can be
entirely addressed with a 1-liner in virtio kernel side to allow the
arch to plumb alternate DMA ops.

So for some reason you seem to be dead set on a path that leads to
mountain of user pain, changes to many different projects and overall
havok while there is a much much simpler and elegant solution at hand
which I described (again) in the response to Ram I sent about 5mn ago.
