Let me restate it: DMA API has support for a wide range of hardware, and
hardware based virtio implementations likely won't benefit from all of
it.

And given virtio right now is optimized for specific workloads, improving
portability without regressing performance isn't easy.

I think it's unsurprising since it started a strictly a guest/host
mechanism.  People did implement offloads on specific platforms though,
and they are known to work. To improve portability even further,
we might need to make spec and code changes.

I'm not really sympathetic to people complaining that they can't even
set a flag in qemu though. If that's the case the stack in question is
way too inflexible.

Maybe we need to extend the meaning of PLATFORM_IOMMU or rename it.

It's possible that some setups will benefit from a more
fine-grained approach where some aspects of the DMA
API are bypassed, others aren't.

This seems to be what was being asked for in this thread,
with comments claiming IOMMU flag adds too much overhead.

I don't think you mean bars. That's unrelated to DMA.

SEV guys report that they just set the iommu flag and then it all works.
I guess if there's translation we can think of this as a kind of iommu.
Maybe we should rename PLATFORM_IOMMU to PLARTFORM_TRANSLATION?

And apparently some people complain that just setting that flag makes
qemu check translation on each access with an unacceptable performance
overhead.  Forcing same behaviour for everyone on general principles
even without the flag is unlikely to make them happy.

You mean dma_Xmb and friends?
There's a new feature VIRTIO_F_IO_BARRIER that's being proposed
for that.

I don't really know what VIVT is. Could you help me please?

Don't do it then?

I guess it isn't an issue as long as WC isn't actually used.
It will become an issue when virtio spec adds some WC capability -
I suspect we can ignore this for now.

It's both a device and a platform issue. A PV device is often more like
another CPU than like a PCI device.
