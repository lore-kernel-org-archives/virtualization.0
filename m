You are ignoring my response to patch 12/12 for some reason (which
repeated a bunch of the questions I had with that patch the last time it
was posted.)  That is what I am referring to here.  None of those
questions were addressed.

Also, how was I to know that those 3 comments above were addressed?
When someone posts questions and comments, please respond to those
comments.  Don't just not respond at all and post the whole series 2
weeks later with things changed and a vague comment of "summary of
changes" in the 00 message.  Otherwise I will assume that you never even
saw my post.

In other words, if someone takes the time to review and post comments,
the least you can do is acknowledge those comments, right?

thanks,

greg k-h
