  Hi,

Thanks for the heads up.

I highly doubt we'll ever change that.
But we can give each struct field its own row, sure.

Why?  As long as we have only 32bit fields in the struct the struct
itself gets a 32bit alignment too.  So no layout differences between
32bit and 64bit.

See above, very unlikely.  And should that really happen we have bigger
problems anyway because it is quite likely that we have to touch the
virtio wire protocol too.

IMO this makes things more complicated for no good reason.
