Good question!

I did a quick check. virtio_ccw_init() should be OK, because we don't
register the driver if allocation fails, so the thing is going to end
up dysfunctional as expected.

If however cio_dma_pool_init() fails, then we end up with the same
problem with airqs, just on the !AIRQ_IV_CACHELINE code path. It can be
fixed analogously: make cio_dma_zalloc() fail all allocation if
cio_dma_pool_init() failed before.

The rest should be OK.

panic() sounds very reasonable to me. As an user I would like to see a
message that tells me, I'm trying to boot with insufficient RAM. Is there
such a message somewhere?

OK. I intend to send out v5 with these changes tomorrow in the
afternoon:
