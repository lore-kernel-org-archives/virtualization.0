No - the ring size itself.

We need some kind of limit on how many requests a guest can queue in the
host, or it's an obvious DoS attack vector. We used the ring size for
that.

Yes it does. Examples above:

it's easier to see if you enable the watchdog timer for virtio. Linux
supports that.

I don't know what happens if these NICs hold onto packets for seconds.
