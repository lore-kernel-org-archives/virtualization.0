OK. What you *really* want is smp_*mb_even_if_compiled_for_UP() ;)
That is, a small set of primitives that are compiled with CONFIG_SMP
(and given some xxx_ prefix to distinguish).

IO barriers are probably the best thing you can use for the moment.

Well, no you have to be careful. Because even if we did ask for ia64's
xchg to be a full barrier, you wouldn't get the right behaviour on UP
because it would be free to optimise that away -- those kinds of barriers
referred to in all those primitives are defined for cacheable memory and
CPU-to-CPU only...

I guess under the circumstances, leaving the ifdef there is probably
reasonable.
