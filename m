Exactly. I am just worried about in the end being no major users and we
are being stuck with a niche driver that as a result is very hard to test.
And the reason for the fear is the initial negative reaction from the
qemu side.  And no if it's there we can't just drop it.

I don't see how it helps.  The driver is either a guaranteed ABI or not.
I'd prefer not to have vhost users outside drivers/vhost/ since it is
harder for me to keep track of them.

What's the problem with staging proposal? It's just another hoop to jump
through to enable it?
