__GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL makes the allocator retry the costly_order allocations

If the array is <= PAGE_SIZE, vmalloc will not use __GFP_NORETRY. So it 
still hides some bugs - such as, if a structure grows above 4k, it would 
start randomly crashing due to memory fragmentation.

There are 489 kernel options declared with the __setup keyword. Hardly any 
kernel developer notices that a new one was added and selects it when 
testing his code.

The injected faults cause damage to the user, so there's no point to 
enable them by default. vmalloc fallback should not cause any damage 
(assuming that the code is correctly written).

This seems like a lost case. So, let's not care about code correctness and 
let's solve crashes only after they are reported. If the upstream wants to 
work this way, there's nothing that can be done about it.

I'm wondering if I can still push it to RHEL or not.
