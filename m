Folks, I had a version running with slight changes to the initial
v1 patch set together with a revert of 414cbd1e3d14 "s390/airq: provide 
cacheline aligned ivs". That of course has the deficit of the memory
usage pattern.

Now you are discussing same substantial changes. The exercise was to
get an initial working code through the door. We really need a decision!
