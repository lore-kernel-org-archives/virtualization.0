Let's take a step back from from the implementation.  What is a driver
for a virtio PCI device (i.e. a PCI device with vendor 0x1af4)
supposed to do on ppc64?

It can send the device physical addresses and ignore the normal PCI
DMA semantics, which is what the current virtio_pci driver does.  This
seems like a layering violation, and this won't work if the device is
a real PCI device.  Alternatively, it can treat the device like any
other PCI device and use the IOMMU.  This is a bit slower, and it is
also incompatible with current hypervisors.

There really are virtio devices that are pieces of silicon and not
figments of a hypervisor's imagination [1].  We could teach virtio_pci
to use physical addressing on ppc64, but that seems like a pretty
awful hack, and it'll start needing quirks as soon as someone tries to
plug a virtio-speaking PCI card into a ppc64 machine.

Ideas?  x86 and arm seem to be safe here, since AFAIK there is no such
thing as a physically addressed virtio "PCI" device on a bus with an
IOMMU on x86, arm, or arm64.
