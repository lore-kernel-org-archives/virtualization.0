It's not an HV call, it's a UV call, qemu won't see it, qemu isn't
trusted. Now the UV *will* reflect that to the HV via some synthetized
HV calls, and we *could* have those do a pass by qemu, however, so far,
our entire design doesn't rely on *any* qemu knowledge whatsoever and
it would be sad to add it just for that purpose.

Additionally, this is rather orthogonal, see my other email, the
problem we are trying to solve is *not* a qemu problem and it doesn't
make sense to leak that into qemu.

Yes, a UV call goes to the Ultravisor, not the Hypervisor. The
Hypervisor isn't trusted.
