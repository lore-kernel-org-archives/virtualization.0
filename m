How did you trigger this sequence?  I'd like to reproduce it.

You are right, the source/destination address could be reused while the
remote still has the connection in their table.  Connection
establishment would fail with a RST reply.

I can think of two solutions:

1. Implementations must remove connections from their table as soon as
   SHUTDOWN_TX|SHUTDOWN_RX is received.  This way the source/destination
   address tuple can be reused immediately, i.e. new connections with
   the same source/destination would be possible while an application is
   still draining the receive buffers of an old connection.

2. Extend the connection lifecycle so that an A->B
   SHUTDOWN_TX|SHUTDOWN_RX must be followed by a by a B->A RST to close
   a connection.  This way the source/destination address is only in use
   once at a time.

Option #2 seems safer because there is no overlap in source/destination
address usage.
