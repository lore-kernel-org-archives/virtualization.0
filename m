Hmm. Are you happy with the ioctl name? If yes I think being consistent
with that is important.

I started with this but I was always getting confused whether this
includes all features or just acked features.  I'll go with
enabled_features.

Exactly. That's what VHOST_GET/SET_VRING_BASE does.  avail_idx is just a
cached value for notify on empty, so what this does is clear the value.
What exactly do you refer to when you say "this looks wrong"?
This could trigger an extra notification if I ever called
trigger_irq without get first. As I don't, it in fact has no effect.

Yes, I remember that patch. There seems to be little point though, at
this stage.

avail_idx is there for notify on empty: I had this thought that it's
better to leave the avail cache line alone when we are triggering
interrupt to avoid bouncing it around if guest is updating it meanwhile
on another CPU, and I think my testing showed that it helped
performance, but could be a mistake.  You don't believe this can help?

Will do.

Not really :) I'll keep this in mind for the future.
Thanks!
