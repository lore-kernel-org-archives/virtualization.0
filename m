I am sure MST can explain it better, but I'll try one more time.
Device will have two BARs with kick register one is PIO another is MMIO.
Old driver works only with PIO new one support both. MMIO is used only
when PIO space is exhausted. So old driver will not be able to drive new
virtio device that have no PIO bar configured.

I am trying to run vmexit test on AMD now, but something does not work
there. Next week I'll fix it and see how AMD differs, bit on Intel those are the
numbers.
