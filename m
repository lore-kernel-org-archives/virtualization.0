Hi,

I have constructed a test where I run an un-paced  UDP_STREAM test in
one guest and a paced omni rr test in another guest at the same time.
Breifly I get the following results from the omni test..

1. Omni test only:		MEAN_LATENCY=272.00
2. Omni and stream test:	MEAN_LATENCY=3423.00
3. cpu and net_cls group:	MEAN_LATENCY=493.00
   As per 2 plus cgoups are created for each guest
   and guest tasks added to the groups
4. 100Mbit/s class:		MEAN_LATENCY=273.00
   As per 3 plus the net_cls groups each have a 100MBit/s HTB class
5. cpu.shares=128:		MEAN_LATENCY=652.00
   As per 4 plus the cpu groups have cpu.shares set to 128
6. Busy CPUS:			MEAN_LATENCY=15126.00
   As per 5 but the CPUs are made busy using a simple shell while loop

There is a bit of noise in the results as the two netperf invocations
aren't started at exactly the same moment

For reference, my netperf invocations are:
netperf -c -C -t UDP_STREAM -H 172.17.60.216 -l 12
netperf.omni -p 12866 -D -c -C -H 172.17.60.216 -t omni -j -v 2 -- -r 1 -d rr -k foo -b 1 -w 200 -m 200

foo contains
PROTOCOL
THROUGHPUT,THROUGHPUT_UNITS
LOCAL_SEND_THROUGHPUT
LOCAL_RECV_THROUGHPUT
REMOTE_SEND_THROUGHPUT
REMOTE_RECV_THROUGHPUT
RT_LATENCY,MIN_LATENCY,MEAN_LATENCY,MAX_LATENCY
P50_LATENCY,P90_LATENCY,P99_LATENCY,STDDEV_LATENCY
LOCAL_CPU_UTIL,REMOTE_CPU_UTIL
