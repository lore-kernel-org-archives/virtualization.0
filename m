We used to stop the handling of tx when the number of pending DMAs
exceeds VHOST_MAX_PEND. This is used to reduce the memory occupation
of both host and guest. But it was too aggressive in some cases, since
any delay or blocking of a single packet may delay or block the guest
transmission. Consider the following setup:

    +-----+        +-----+
    | VM1 |        | VM2 |
    +--+--+        +--+--+
       |              |
    +--+--+        +--+--+
    | tap0|        | tap1|
    +--+--+        +--+--+
       |              |
    pfifo_fast   htb(10Mbit/s)
       |              |
    +--+--------------+---+
    |     bridge          |
    +--+------------------+
       |
    pfifo_fast
       |
    +-----+
    | eth0|(100Mbit/s)
    +-----+

- start two VMs and connect them to a bridge
- add an physical card (100Mbit/s) to that bridge
- setup htb on tap1 and limit its throughput to 10Mbit/s
- run two netperfs in the same time, one is from VM1 to VM2. Another is
  from VM1 to an external host through eth0.
- result shows that not only the VM1 to VM2 traffic were throttled but
  also the VM1 to external host through eth0 is also throttled somehow.

This is because the delay added by htb may lead the delay the finish
of DMAs and cause the pending DMAs for tap0 exceeds the limit
(VHOST_MAX_PEND). In this case vhost stop handling tx request until
htb send some packets. The problem here is all of the packets
transmission were blocked even if it does not go to VM2.

We can solve this issue by relaxing it a little bit: switching to use
data copy instead of stopping tx when the number of pending DMAs
exceed the VHOST_MAX_PEND. This is safe because:

- The number of pending DMAs were still limited by VHOST_MAX_PEND
- The out of order completion during mode switch can make sure that
  most of the tx buffers were freed in time in guest.

So even if about 50% packets were delayed in zero-copy case, vhost
could continue to do the transmission through data copy in this case.

Test result:

Before this patch:
VM1 to VM2 throughput is 9.3Mbit/s
VM1 to External throughput is 40Mbit/s

After this patch:
VM1 to VM2 throughput is 9.3Mbit/s
Vm1 to External throughput is 93Mbit/s

Simple performance test on 40gbe shows no obvious changes in
throughput after this patch.

The patch only solve this issue when unlimited sndbuf. We still need a
solution for limited sndbuf.
