Because per-target doesn't have IRQ affinity for a particular CPU.

Assuming that the thread that is sending requests to the device is
I/O-bound, it is likely to be sleeping at the time the ISR is executed,
and thus executing the ISR on the same processor that sent the requests
is cheap.

But if you have many such I/O-bound processes, the kernel will execute
the ISR on a random processor, rather than the one that is sending
requests to the device.
