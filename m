All 6 patches applied.

Next time, PLEASE, give me a header email ala "[PATCH net-next v4 0/6]" giving
a broad overview of the series.

This serves several purposes.

First, it gives me a single top-level email to reply to when I want to let
you know that I've either applied or rejected this series.  Because you
didn't provide a header posting, I have to pick an arbitrary one of
the patches to use for this purpose as I have done here.

Second, it gives a place for you to describe at a high level what the patch
series is doing.  I create dummy merge commits and place that descriptive
text into it, so that anyone else looking at the GIT history can see that
these patches go together as a coherent unit and what that unit is trying
to achieve.

Thanks.
