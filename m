I think that's right I probably finally got it back to normal behavior
with order-0 allocations.

Sure but the rate of network packets in and out and subsequent
allocations would be more equivalent to a fork bomb than normal
forking. I understand mm should work more sanely in this scenario but
at the same time we see a bad regression with this code, I see we're
not alone.

We're leaving about half for the kernel so I wouldn't call it "deep".
Any server application that is using page cache and mlocked memory
will run into similar issues.

Having lots of memory mlocked is bad right now yes, but not
necessarily an uncommon scenario. We're handing mm an almost
intractable problem. I see compaction of mlocked pages has been
discussed a few times over there, but no patch has actually made it
in.
