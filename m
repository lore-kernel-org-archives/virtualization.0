I thought I had answered you before, maybe the message was lost or the 
answer was not complete. Anyway, I will try to response to your question 
again here.

That is not exactly the same. The loop will exit if other bits are set or the pending
bit cleared. In the case, we will need to do the same check at the beginning of the
for loop in order to avoid doing an extra cmpxchg that is not necessary.

As I said before, I did see a difference with that change. I think it 
depends on the CPU chip that we used for testing. I ran my test on a 
10-core Westmere-EX chip. I run my microbench on different pairs of core 
within the same chip. It produces different results that varies from 
779.5ms to up to 1192ms. Without that patch, the lowest value I can get 
is still close to 800ms, but the highest can be up to 1800ms or so. So I 
believe it is just a matter of timing that you did not observed in your 
test machine.
