That makes sense, but is still totally crazy for what a kref was
designed to do.  I'm really wary of giving access to the count of the
kref like this as it will almost always be abused (it's been asked for
before, but not like this.)

So how about just "open coding" a kref for this structure, as it wants
something that doesn't fit into the kref model, and should be pretty
simple to do (you can ensure you get the locking right, unlike almost
all users of krefs, as Al Viro constantly points out to me...)
