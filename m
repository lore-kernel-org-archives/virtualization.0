Hi Jason,

The initial rationale was that this extra space is due to
internal fragmentation in the page frag allocator, but I agree with
you -- this code should be changed and the extra space accounted for.
Any internal fragmentation leading to a larger last packet allocated from
the page should be reflected in the SKB truesize of the last packet.

I will do a followup patchset that accounts correctly for the extra
space, which will also me to remove the two max statements you
indicated. Thanks for finding this issue.

I believe the put_page here is sufficient for correctness. When we
allocate a buffer using skb_page_frag_refill, we use get_page/put_page
to allocate/free respectively. For example, if the virtqueue_add_inbuf
succeeded, we would eventually call put_page either in virtio-net
(e.g., page_to_skb for packets <= GOOD_COPY_LEN bytes) or later in
__skb_frag_unref and other functions called during dev_kfree_skb.

However, an offset rollback does allow the space to be reused by the next
allocation, which could be a good optimization. I can do the offset
rollback (with a put_page) in the next patchset. What do you think?

I think this is safe with one caveat -- we can't modify
rq->mrg_buf_ctx until we know the ring isn't full (otherwise, we
clobber an in-use entry). It is safe to modify rq->mrg_buf_ctx
after we know that virtqueue_add_inbuf has succeeded.

I can remove the rq_num_free check from try_fill_recv, and then
modify virtqueue_add_inbuf to use a local mergeable_receive_buf_ctx.
Once virtqueue_add_inbuf succeeds, the contents of the local variable
can be copied to rq->mrg_buf_ctx[rq->mrg_buf_ctx_head].

Best,

Mike
