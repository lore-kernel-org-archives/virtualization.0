No worries, and thanks for getting back to this.

Yes, the former is possible and usually how that happens, but it is not
guaranteed, thus the latter might happen -- unintentionally.

For example, a sysctl setting can be configured in /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf,
which is manually tested and confirmed to apply it correctly. However,
that might have worked only because its module was inadvertently loaded
earlier (e.g., for something else by the sysadmin, or by something else
in the system). The next time the system boots, the module is not
automatically loaded, thus the sysctl setting fails to be applied when
the (previously working) /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf is parsed.

Also, a sysctl setting may, or may not, be tied to a module; it can be
built-in. This can change with kernel configuration, e.g., distro.

So, another example: a sysadmin learns of a sysctl setting in
documentation tested with another distro, which has it built-in. It
fails to apply on this distro, which has it in a module, because the
module isn't loaded. (Now the sysadmin is left to figure that out, and
then which kernel module provides the sysctl setting.) 

Note that both examples can be combined. (And the poor sysadmin is, in a
reboot happening days/weeks/months later, left to also figure out that
the sysctl setting is not applied, and whatever effect that caused,
because that particular module was not loaded on boot, and should be
added to /etc/modules).

The sysctl tools and configuration files only know about the file path,
not the module. The sysctl tools know the file path when parsing the
configuration files, converting a 'dir.file = value' line into opening
/proc/sys/dir/value and writing value into it.

The format of configuration files only include file paths and values,
but not modules, per sysctl.conf(5) and sysctl.d(5). This is reasonable,
as there may, or may not, be a module for the sysctl setting (i.e.,
module vs. built-in).

Maybe I misunderstand the context for your questions; please let me
know.
Also, could you please clarify what you mean by 'include the modules
that go with them' [sysctl path files] ?

In general, there is no guarantee that a module is loaded by the time a
sysctl setting is about to be applied -- during system boot or even
later.

The example for system boot is covered previously. An example for
'later' / after system boot: on network device testing which includes
module unload/reload and sysctl settings for network performance, one
might unload the module, and mistakenly first apply sysctl settings then
reload the module, thus loosing the performance tuning on that one
testing round.

Sorry, not sure I understand the meaning of 'update' correctly, but yes,
if there is a hard-coded module load (e.g., /etc/modules or in scripts),
that happens. However, AFAICT, loading unexpected modules is less of a
problem than not loading required modules, or may not be a problem.

With an auto-load mechanism in place, hard-coding/force-load is not
required, and neither problem (loading unexpected modules due to
hard-coding, and not loading required modules due to lack of
hard-coding) would happen, IIUIC.

This scheme currently covers all modules, AFAIK, as it is wrapped in the
functions that register sysctl tables.

On moving forward: usage of such functions in a way that breaks a
requirement of this series (e.g., failing to specify the template
table/path parameter(s), or not having constant initializers) hits a
build error, as the requirements are actually from the compiler.

Ok, cool. I can work on a different design.

Please just let me know whether you are OK with the remaining (above),
and I'll be happy to tackle this.
