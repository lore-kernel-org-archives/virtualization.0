Why ? I disagree, the flag should be honored when set in any
architecture. PowerPC is no different than any other platform in that
regard.

This is just a matter of what is the default of the flag, ie we
should have a machine flag that indicates what the default is for
new virtio devices, otherwise, it should be specified per device
as an attribute of the device instance.

I would argue that we should default to "bypass IOMMU" on *all*
architecture due to the performance impact, and to essentially
default to the same behaviour as today. With things like DDW even
powerpc might be able to mostly alleviate the performance impact
so we might to change in the long term, but I tend to prefer
more incremental approaches.

This should be configurable.

I disagree with the kernel bit and I disagree with special casing PPC in
any shape or form in the code. The only difference should be a default
value for the iommu mode of virtio in qemu set per machine.

You can then feel free to change that default (in a separate patch for
bisectability) on x86 for the sake of Xen.
