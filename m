Is this a problem in the Linux side?  If so, that could easily be fixed.

That's a different issue, and one that I am very surprised to hear.
That kind of invalidates ever being able to update the driver in a guest
for a long-running system that you want to migrate and not reboot.  That
sounds like a major bug in hyper-v, don't you agree?

Why isn't that allowed to be unloaded?  What happens if it does?

I would like to see the following be possible from Linux:
	- running Linux guest on hyperv
	- need to migrate to a newer version of hyper-v
	- pause long-running userspace processes.
	- unload hyperv modules
	- migrate guest to newer hyperv version (possible different host
	  machine)
	- load newer hyperv modules
	- resume long-running guest processes

If this isn't possible due to hyper-v bugs, then I guess we need to be
able to live with it, but we had better advertise it pretty well as I
know people will want to be able to do the above sequence for their
guest instances.

If so, can you expand this patch to say more in the changelog entry, and
resend the remaining patches that I didn't apply as they are now gone
from my pending-patch queue.

Ok, so if this is going to be fixed, why do we need to prevent this from
ever being possible to have happen on our side?

thanks,
