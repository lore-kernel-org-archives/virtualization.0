I seems like the same goes for the current Linux kernel implementation
that if processes issued a lot of I/O requests and the io-request queue
of a disk is overflowed, all the I/O requests after will be blocked
and the priorities of them are meaningless.
In other word, it won't work if it receives lots of requests more than
the ability/bandwidth of a disk.

It doesn't seem so weird if it won't work if a cgroup issues lots of
I/O requests more than the bandwidth which is assigned to the cgroup.
