Great idea, that sounds very intresting.

I'll add it to the wiki.

In fact a bit of complexity in vhost was put there in the vague hope to
support something like this: virtio rings are not translated through
regular memory tables, instead, vhost gets a pointer to ring address.

This allows qemu acting as a man in the middle,
verifying the descriptors but not touching the

Anyone interested in working on such a project?
