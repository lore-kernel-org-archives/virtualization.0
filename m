It's just a single TCP_STREAM from local host to guest with vhost_net
enabled. The host and guest were connected with bridge.

The problem is the overhead of introduced by the frag refill and frag
list. Looking at tg3 and bnx2x, the frag were only used for small
packets not for jumbo frame which does not need a frag list. But your
patch tires to use it for GSO packets. So we'd better to solve it in
device level (e.g multiple rings with different size of buffers).

I try to change the queue size from 256 to 1024. Unfortunately, I didn't
see improvement. As a workaround, If you care only the MTU size packet
and do not want GSO packet to be received, you can just disable it by
specifying gso_tso{4|6}=off in qemu command line or let's make it
configurable through ethtool.
