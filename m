I see.  I guess you can rewrite this as:
atomic_inc
if (atomic_read() == 1)
which is a bit cheaper, and make the fact
that you do not need increment and return to be atomic,
explicit.

Another simple idea: store last processor id in target,
if it is unchanged no need to play with req_vq
and take spinlock.

Also - some kind of comment explaining why a similar race can not happen
with this lock in place would be nice: I see why this specific race can
not trigger but since lock is dropped later before you submit command, I
have hard time convincing myself what exactly gurantees that vq is never
switched before or even while command is submitted.
