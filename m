Yes, xs_init() runs after consoles register.  I don't know whether
that could be changed.

The kernel routes printk output to all enabled console drivers, but
/dev/console can be connected to only one of them.  That's the
preferred console.

Getting the preferred console right is important for user space.  For
instance, if /dev/console is hvc, anaconda does a text install.  Not
good when the user is looking at a fully functional PVFB, wondering
why the installer doesn't come up.

My hack makes sure that both tty (PVFB if enabled, else dummy) and hvc
are enabled by default.  That's the easy part.  The hackish part makes
sure that the right one ends up as the preferred console.

That could be an argument for preferring the force_console() solution
over the hvc_force_consdev() solution.

Thanks!  I'll try to post a proper patch tomorrow.
