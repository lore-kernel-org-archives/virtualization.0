The way our secure mode architecture is designed, there doesn't need at
this point to be any knowledge at qemu level whatsoever. Well at least
until we do migration but that's a different kettle of fish. In any
case, the guest starts normally (which means as a non-secure guest, and
thus expects normal virtio, our FW today doesn't handle
VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM, though granted, we can fix this), and later
that guest issues some special Ultravisor call that turns it into a
secure guest.

There is some involvement of the hypervisor, but not qemu at this
stage. We would very much like to avoid that, as it would be a hassle
for users to have to use different libvirt options etc... bcs the guest
might turn itself into a secure VM.

Any serious reason why not just getting that 2 line patch allowing our
arch code to force virtio to use the DMA API ?

It's not particularly invasive and solves our problem rather nicely
without adding overhead or additional knowledge to qemu/libvirt/mgmnt
tools etc... that it doesn't need etc....

The guest knows it's going secure so the guest arch code can do the
right thing rather trivially.

Long term we should probably make virtio always use the DMA API anyway,
and interpose "1:1" dma_ops for the traditional virtio case, that would
reduce code clutter significantly. In that case, it would become just a
matter of having a platform hook to override the dma_ops used.

Cheers,
Ben.
