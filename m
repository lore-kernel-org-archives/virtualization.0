Like Jason wrote, our user‑visible API does not work on non‑coherent
systems, and this is where I'm using the DMA_ATTR_CPU_CACHE_OVERLAP
attribute.

Regarding failure on unsupported systems, I have tried more than once to
make the RDMA fail when the device is known to take the SWIOTLB path
in RDMA and cannot operate correctly, but each attempt was met with a
cold reception:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/d18c454636bf3cfdba9b66b7cc794d713eadc4a5.1719909395.git.leon@kernel.org/

I'm afraid the outcome will be the same this time as well.
