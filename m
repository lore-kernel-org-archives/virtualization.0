It has already worked this way, as the tx queue were choose based on tx 
hash in guest(),  but vhost thread can move among processors.

The problem is that vhost does not handle TCP itself but ixgbe driver 
would think it does, so the nic would deliver packets of a single flow 
to different CPUs when the vhost thread who does the transmission moves.

So, in conclusion, if we do not consider features of  under layer nic, 
using rxhash instead of queue mappings to identify a flow is better.
