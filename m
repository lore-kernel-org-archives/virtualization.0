If by 'this' you mean the use of perfect filters or a large hash table
to select the RX queue per flow, then 'flow steering'.

But that is usually combined with the fall-back of a simple mapping from
hash to queue ('RSS' or 'flow hashing') in case there is no specific
queue selection yet, which I can see tun has.  And you're specifying
multiple transmit queues too.  If you want a name for the whole set of
features involved, I don't see any better name than 'multiqueue'/'MQ'.

If you want a name for this specific flow steering mechanism, add some
distinguishing adjective(s) like 'virtual' or 'automatic'.

Ben.
