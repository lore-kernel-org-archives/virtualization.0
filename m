No trailing data-dependent read, so agreed, no smp_read_barrier_depends()
needed.  That said, I believe that we should encourage rcu_dereference*()
or lockless_dereference() instead of READ_ONCE() for documentation
reasons, though.

The other problem with smp_read_barrier_depends() is that it is often
a pain figuring out which prior load it is supposed to apply to.
Hence my preference for rcu_dereference*() and lockless_dereference().

It looks like I should add words to memory-barriers.txt de-emphasizing
smp_read_barrier_depends().  I will take a look at that.

Well, if it makes you feel better, that was control dependencies and this
was data dependencies.  So it was not -exactly- the same.  ;-)

(Sorry, couldn't resist...)

Agreed.  We can worry about whether or not we replace the current
smp_read_barrier_depends() with that new barrier when and if such
hardware appears.

;-) ;-) ;-)

Apparently at least some hardware vendors are reading memory-barriers.txt,
so perhaps the odds of that kind of breakage have reduced.

								Thanx, Paul
