I'm not sure that there is a way to do this that is correct in the
generic case.  It's possible that the destination could be a VM while
packets are being mirrored to a physical device or we could be
multicasting or some other arbitrarily complex scenario.  Just think
of what a physical switch would do if it has ports with two different
speeds.
