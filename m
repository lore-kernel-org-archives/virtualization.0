Last I looked, it does on everything, it bypasses the DMA layer in qemu
which is where IOMMUs are implemented.

Well, *except* virtio, exactly...

Possibly...

I wouldn't be so certain, as I said, the way virtio is implemented in
qemu bypass the DMA layer which is where IOMMUs sit. The fact that
currently x86 doesn't put an IOMMU there is not even garanteed, is it ?
What happens if you try to mix and match virtio and other emulated
devices that require the iommu on the same bus ?

If we could discriminate virtio devices to a specific host bridge and
guarantee no mix & match, we could probably add a concept of
"IOMMU-less" bus but that would require guest changes which limits the
usefulness.

Not with existing guests which cannot be changed. Existing distros are
out with those drivers. If we add a backward compatibility mechanism,
then we could add something yes, provided we can segregate virtio onto a
dedicated host bridge (which can be a problem with the libvirt
trainwreck...)

Cheers,
