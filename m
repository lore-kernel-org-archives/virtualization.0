Actually no. Storage vendors do not want to impose a need to take initiators down for any reason. I have worked for a storage system vendor that routinely did firmware upgrades on-the-fly. This is done by multi-pathing and taking one path down, upgrade, bring up, repeat. There was even one non-redundant system that I am aware of that could upgrade firmware and reboot fast enough that the initiators would not notice.

You do have to pay very close attention to some things however. Don't change the device identity in any way - even version information, otherwise a Windows initiator will blue-screen. I made that mistake myself, so I remember it well. It seemed like such an innocent change. I don't recall there being any issue with adding commands and we did do that on occasion.
