Thanks indeed better aside from the "encrypted guest memory": the 
mechanism used to avoid the access to the guest memory from the host by 
s390 is not encryption but a hardware feature denying the general host 
access and allowing pieces of memory to be shared between guest and host.
As a consequence the data read from memory is not corrupted but not read 
at all and the read error kills the hypervizor with a SIGSEGV.

The goal of the s390 PV feature is to avoid this possibility so I don't 
think so; however, there is a possibility that some hardware VIRTIO 
device gain access to the guest's protected memory, even such device 
does not exist yet.

At the moment such device exists we will need a driver for it, at least 
to enable the feature and apply policies, it is also one of the reasons 
why a hook to the architecture is interesting.

yes, this is also something to fix on the hypervizor side, Halil is 
working on it.

Sadly, putting a warning may not help as qemu is killed if it accesses 
the protected memory.
Also note that the crash occurs not only on start but also on hotplug.

Thanks,
