Aaaha, IOW, that's the "st" column here:

$ vmstat
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- -------cpu-------
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si   so    bi    bo   in   cs us sy id wa st gu

In any case, you could keep that helpful explanation in yout 0th message. :)

Right, why early?

I mean, I am still trying to see the justification for this diffstat

 14 files changed, 247 insertions(+), 51 deletions(-)

and whether it is really worth it.

That should tell you how much we care about UP. We would even love to make SMP
the default.

Yes please.

Also, we have some blurb about how to write those:

https://docs.kernel.org/process/maintainer-tip.html#patch-subject

and

https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html

In talking to Peter about it, we were wondering whether this can be made
simpler. Like do not touch perCPU but do a normal page for each CPU's steal
time gunk and thus do not split the large page and then that early
enc/decrypting of memory I don't like either.

Perhaps we should start with the simplest approach first.

Thx.
