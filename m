This code is actually setting up dom0 which (for the most part) sees the
real hardware.

The hardcoding of the platform is just a short term hack.

Agreed. Our intention was to use DT so this fits perfectly with our
plans.

For dom0 we would expose a (possibly filtered) version of the DT given
to us by the firmware (e.g. we might hide a serial port to reserve it
for Xen's use, we'd likely fiddle with the memory map etc).

For domU the DT would presumably be constructed by the toolstack (in
dom0 userspace) as appropriate for the guest configuration. I guess this
needn't correspond to any particular "real" hardware platform.

On x86 there is an emulated PCI device which serves as the hooking point
for the PV drivers. For ARM I don't think it would be unreasonable to
have a DT entry instead. I think it would be fine just represent the
root of the "xenbus" and further discovery would occur using the normal
xenbus mechanisms (so not a full binding). AIUI for buses which are
enumerable this is the preferred DT scheme to use.

The hcall API we are currently targeting is the existing Xen API (at
least the generic parts of it). These generally deal with fairly Xen
specific concepts like grant tables etc.
