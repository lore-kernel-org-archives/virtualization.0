Yes, but not significantly more than without this patch.

I ran 1, 10 and 100 flow tcp_stream throughput tests from a sender
in the guest to a receiver in the host.

To answer the other benchmark question first, I did not see anything
noteworthy when increasing vq->num from 256 to 1024.

With 1 and 10 flows without this patch all packets use zerocopy.
With the patch, less than 1% eschews zerocopy.

With 100 flows, even without this patch, 90+% of packets are copied.
Some zerocopy packets from vhost_net fail this test in tun.c

    if (iov_iter_npages(&i, INT_MAX) <= MAX_SKB_FRAGS)

Generating packets with up to 21 frags. I'm not sure yet why or
what the fraction of these packets is. But this in turn can
disable zcopy_used in vhost_net_tx_select_zcopy for a
larger share of packets:

        return !net->tx_flush &&
                net->tx_packets / 64 >= net->tx_zcopy_err;

Because the number of copied and zerocopy packets are the
same before and after the patch, so are the overall throughput
numbers.
