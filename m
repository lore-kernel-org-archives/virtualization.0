Hi,

my understanding is that hv driver is actually a bit special in this 
respect -- it's actually all-in-one both low-level and high-level driver. 
I take it that there is not ever going to be a different high-level driver 
using low-level hv transport (is that correct, KY?), so this might indeed 
be an acceptable layout of the driver.

Thanks a lot,
