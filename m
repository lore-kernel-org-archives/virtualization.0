Yes, it seems easiest - particularly given how flaky binutils can get
when you really try to control its ELF generation.

OK.  It seems obvious, but I just wanted to make sure ;)

Well, that's more or less it.  If the decompressor ends up jumping to
startup_32, and that immediately goes into xen_start_kernel(), then
we're still running on the initial bzImage p=v pagetables.  At the
moment, when the domain builder maps the kernel's vmlinux to the vaddrs
in its Phdrs, so there's no need to do any more boot-time pagetable
manipulation.  If we come out of bzImage with only identity mappings,
then obviously the Xen case will need to do the same pagetable setup as
the native case - which is good so long as we can work out how to share
the code to do so.

For i386, it looks like this will be tricky because at this point:

    * we're not running at the linked address, so C code will be tricky
      and non-standard
    * we need to deal with multiple hypervisors and their constraints on
      what can be in a pagetable
    * we could be running with no paging, or paging in either non-PAE or
      PAE modes

Writing some code which can deal with all of those at once will be an
interesting exercise.

The nice thing about having the domain builder create the pagetables is
that it turns it from a tricky bootstrap problem into a relatively easy
job.  The main thing is that the domain builder can create a scaffolding
pagetable which is enough to get everything started.  Once you have that
in place, its pretty easy to update it to set precisely the right bits
in the ptes, etc.

It also means that the path for Xen vs native will be more similar,
because the bzImage code won't need to deal with pagetable setup at all:
for native it won't matter, and for Xen it has already been done.  It
only matters once we hit the 32-bit kernel-proper code, and we diverge
at that point anyway.
