Ok, no good way. yours is wrong, mine is wrong, too.
plz find 3rd way, reasonable.

Below is brief thinking.

"Why process A should be charged to I/O when it just maps anon memory ?"
I can't answer this.

Even in yorr case, Process B requests memory and get penalty. It's
very natural, I think.

In usual case, 
 - if process A maps ANON, there will be no I/O.
 - if process A maps FILE, it will be charged to process A.
ok ?

Under memory pressure,
 - if process A maps ANON, swap I/O should be charged to process B.
 - if process A maps FILE, I/O should be charged to process A.
maybe. 


Anyway, there will be ineraction with dirty_ratio of memcg (not implemeted yet)
and _Owner should be charged_ issue will be handled in this dirty_ratio layer.
More consideration is necessary, I think.
