I have one, too (which is one reasone why I created the original Xen patch).

Program headers you mean.

Symtab should also be deduced from program headers.

I'm actually surprised this got re-implemented from scratch, when my patch
already had both variants (one just #ifdef-ed out), and was tested in both
forms (actually, I first implemented the ELF form, and only after seeing the
bloat it added to the sources I came up with the second variant, which in
the end unfortunately didn't add significantly less bloat to the Makefile.
