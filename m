It looks very clean, thanks. Some documentation suggestions below.
Also - Cc stable on this and the block patch?

One thing I note is that this scheme works because there's a single
entity disabling/enabling napi and the refill thread.
So it's possible that Amit will need to add a lock and track NAPI
state anyway to make suspend work. But we'll see.

- try_fill_recv must always run from napi or with napi disabled ...
- refill only runs when device is open
