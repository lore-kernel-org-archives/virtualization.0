Glad you asked :)


ACPI 1.0 indeed did not place restrictions on it:

6.1.4 _HID
This object is used to supply the OS with the device’s Plug and Play Hardware ID. When
describing a platform, use of any _HID objects is optional. However, a _HID object must
be used to describe any device that will be enumerated by the ACPI driver. The ACPI
driver only enumerates a device when no bus enumerator can detect the device ID. For
example, devices on an ISA bus are enumerated by the ACPI driver. Use the _ADR
object to describe devices enumerated by bus enumerators other than the ACPI driver.
A _HID object evaluates to either a numeric 32-bit compressed EISA type ID or a string.


Then 3.0 was very draconic:
6.1.4 _HID (Hardware ID)
This object is used to supply OSPM with the device’s Plug and Play hardware ID.8 When describing a
platform, use of any _HID objects is optional. However, a _HID object must be used to describe any device
that will be enumerated by OSPM. OSPM only enumerates a device when no bus enumerator can detect the
device ID. For example, devices on an ISA bus are enumerated by OSPM. Use the _ADR object to describe
devices enumerated by bus enumerators other than OSPM.
A _HID object evaluates to either a numeric 32-bit compressed EISA type ID or a string. If a string, the
format must be an alphanumeric PNP or ACPI ID with no asterisk or other leading characters.
A valid PNP ID must be of the form “AAA####” where A is an uppercase letter and # is a hex digit. A
valid ACPI ID must be of the form “ACPI####” where # is a hex digit.

Then 5.0 changed it to:

6.1.5 _HID (Hardware ID)
This object is used to supply OSPM with the device’s Plug and Play hardware ID.1
1.
256
A Plug and Play ID or ACPI ID can be obtained by sending e-mail to pnpid@microsoft.com.
Hewlett-Packard/Intel/Microsoft/Phoenix/ToshibaAdvanced Configuration and Power Interface Specification
When describing a platform, use of any _HID objects is optional. However, a _HID object must be
used to describe any device that will be enumerated by OSPM. OSPM only enumerates a device
when no bus enumerator can detect the device ID. For example, devices on an ISA bus are
enumerated by OSPM. Use the _ADR object to describe devices enumerated by bus enumerators
other than OSPM.
Arguments:
None
Return Value:
An Integer or String containing the HID
A _HID object evaluates to either a numeric 32-bit compressed EISA type ID or a string. If a
string, the format must be an alphanumeric PNP or ACPI ID with no asterisk or other leading
characters.
A valid PNP ID must be of the form "AAA####" where A is an uppercase letter and # is a hex
digit. A valid ACPI ID must be of the form "NNNN####" where N is an uppercase letter or a
digit ('0'-'9') and # is a hex digit. This specification reserves the string "ACPI" for use only
with devices defined herein. It further reserves all strings representing 4 HEX digits for
exclusive use with PCI-assigned Vendor IDs.



Long story short, QEMUVGID is indeed out of spec, but it works
both because of guest compatibility with ACPI 1.0, and because no one
much uses it.
