It doesn't hurt, the lock is mostly uncontended.

- if you have lots of I/O, it's held for a very small period of time; if
you have little I/O, it's uncontended anyway.

- the SCSI layer will serialize on the host lock anyway before calling
into the LLD.  Locks are "pipelined" so that in the end the host lock
will be a bigger bottleneck than the others.

Most of the time it only costs 2 extra atomic operations, which should
be galf a microsecond or less.
