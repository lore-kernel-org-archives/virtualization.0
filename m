When this stuff was discussed, we chose to have a nop on 64bits.

Your point has little to do with 64bit stats, it was already like that
with 'long int' counters.

Consider average driver doing :

dev->stats.rx_bytes += skb->len;
dev->stats.rx_packets++;

A concurrent reader can read an updated rx_bytes and a 'previous'
rx_packets one.

'fixing' this requires a lot of work and memory barriers (in all
drivers), for a very litle gain (at most one packet error)

u64_stats_sync was really meant to be 0-cost on 64bit arches.
