Yes but you also wrote:
	If these bits are set and there are no more virtqueue buffers
	pending the socket is disconnected.

how does remote know that there are no buffers pending and so it's safe
to reuse the same source/destination address now?  Maybe destination
should send RST at that point?

I wonder how this interacts with the disconnect on migration
idea that you discussed. Specifically, socket has to stay connected
