Interesting observation - yes, I think deprecating both pre-existing
methods in favor of something along those lines would be desirable.
(But I'd favor not using the term "order" here as it is - at least in
Linux - usually implied to be used on pages. "max-ringent-log2"
perhaps?)

What you say also implies that all currently floating around Linux
backend patches are flawed in their way of calculating the number
of ring entries, as this number really depends on the protocol the
frontend advertises.

Further, if you're concerned about wasting ring space (and
particularly in the context of your request number/size/segments
extension), shouldn't we bother to define pairs (or larger groups)
of struct blkif_request_segment (as currently a quarter of the space
is mere padding)? Or split grefs from {first,last}_sect altogether?

Finally, while looking at all this again, I stumbled across the use
of blkif_vdev_t in the ring structures: At least Linux'es blkback
completely ignores this field - {xen_,}vbd_translate() simply
overwrites what dispatch_rw_block_io() put there (and with this,
struct phys_req's dev and bdev members seem rather pointless too).
Does anyone recall what the original intention with this request field
was? Allowing I/O on multiple devices over a single ring?

Bottom line - shouldn't we define a blkif2 interface to cleanly
accommodate all the various extensions (and do away with the
protocol variations)?
