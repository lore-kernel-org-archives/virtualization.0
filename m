I think this is what the original patchset did, but I don't really get
why this is a good idea.
Why should we select a frame at random and make it's truesize bigger?
All frames are to blame for the extra space.
Just ignoring it seems more symmetrical.

If you intend to repost anyway (for the below wrinkle) then
you can do it right here just as well I guess. Seems a bit prettier.

You don't have to fill in ctx before calling add_inbuf, do you?
Just fill it afterwards.
