What I am referring to here is to change the gso_type to UDPV6 in tap/macvtap
when passing packet to the host.

So, I am not try to pass fragment IDs yet.  I am trying to make sure that
older gueest that assume that UFO == UFO4 + UFO6 continue to work and do not
regress.  At the same time, I want to enable UFO(4) for new guests.

If we set gso_type to SKB_GSO_UDPV6 before passing the data to the forwarding
path of the host, then this will cause IPv6 fragmentation.  If we leave gso_type
as SKB_GSO_UDP, then older VMs will continue to communicate using large UDP
data packets.

Later when VMs support UFO6, when UFO6 is enabled, the fragment id can be communicated.
But that's later.

OK, virtio seems to be the only nic doing this... You are right, I
need to cover that scenario.
