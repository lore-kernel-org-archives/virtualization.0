Hi Anthony.

I removed original mail and did not check archive, but doesn't rx/tx
queues of the virtio device have limited size? I do hope they have,
which means that either your network drops packets or blocks.


Having dedicated preconfigured network device is essentially the same as
having this special socket option: guests which do not have this (either
network or vchannel socket) will not be able to communicate with the
host, so there is no difference. Except that usual network will just
work out of the box (and especially you will like it when there will be
no need to hack on X to support new network media).

Another approach is to implement that virtio backend with netlink based
userspace interface (like using connector or genetlink). This does not
differ too much from what you have with special socket family, but at
least it does not duplicate existing functionality of
userspace-kernelspace communications.

But IMO having special network device or running your protocol over
existing virtio network device is a cleaner solution both from technical
and convenience points of view.
