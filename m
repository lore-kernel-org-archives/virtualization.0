The cxgb3 driver has had skb_orphan in its transmit routine forever (also 
due to lack of Tx interrupts) and I am not aware of adverse effects caused 
by doing so.  It does skip skb_orphan when skb_shared but probably nobody 
sends sharead skbs with destructors.

The only application I know of that has trouble with lazy skb freeing is 
pktgen because it treats freeing as an indication that the packet has been 
transmitted so it's thrown off if packets sit there for a while.  (Also 
freeing just indicates that the DMA is done, not that the packet has been 
sent, and modern devices have quite a bit of buffering.)

There's a comment in the cxgb3 driver where it calls skb_orphan that 
explains the rationale and includes some of what you're saying.
