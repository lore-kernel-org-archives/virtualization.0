We've always planned to do this.  We just didn't want to create the 
dependency between paravirt_ops and clockevents too early such that they 
would depend on each other to merge to main line.  Now that they are 
both there, we are all for it.

Huh?  paravirt_ops isn't a hypervisor interface, it's just a linux code 
abstraction.  The code on both sides of paravirt_ops is *linux* code, 
any way you cut it.  clockevents is already a linux code abstraction. 
why introduce the redundancy?

You would be introducing the same redundancy.

vmi_timer_ops.whatever is where the kernel <-> hypervisor boundary is 
crossed for VMI.

No, that was not the point of paravirt_ops.  It is actually the complete 
opposite of the intention of paravirt_ops.  paravirt_ops' intent is 
exactly to allow for *multiple* hypervisor ABIs to exist in the kernel.

At kernel summit, paravirt_ops was proposed to allow for multiple 
hypervisor ABI's to be targeted by the kernel.  The code on both sides 
of paravirt_ops is *linux* code.

Again, you are misunderstanding the intent of paravirt_ops and history 
behind it's development.

Again, I said in a previous mail that we am fine with introducing our 
own interrupt handler rather than using the lapic one.
