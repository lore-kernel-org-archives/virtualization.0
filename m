the thing is, I'd rather see a long backtrace that is hard to decipher but =

Because that's really the issue: do you want a "pretty" backtrace, or do =

you want one that is rock solid but has some crud in it.

I'll take the rock solid one any day. Especially as even the pretty one =

won't fix the most common problem, which is "I don't see the caller" (due =

to inlining or tail-calls).

In contrast, the ugly backtrace will have some "garbage entries" from =

previous frames that didn't get overwritten, but there have actually been =

(admittedly rare) cases where those garbage entries have given hints about =

what happened just before.
