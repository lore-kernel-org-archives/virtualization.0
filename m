Hi Jason,

So far nothing concrete.

I haven't got any results for small packet, but will run this week
and send an update. I remember my earlier patches having regression
for small packets.

I don't recollect small packet performance for guest->local host.
Also, using multiple tuns devices on the bridge (instead of mq-tun)
balances the rx/tx of a flow to a single vq. Then you can avoid
mq-tun with it's queue selector function, etc. Have you tried it?

I will run my tests this week and get back.
