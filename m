I think in my original comments I noted that I preferred GET / SET, rather
than GET/ACK.

Ah, you actually refresh it every time anyway.  Hmm, could you do my poor
brain a favor and either just get_user it in vhost_trigger_irq(), or call
it 'cached_avail_idx' or something?

Well, it avoids this ioctl, by exposing all the state.  We may well need it
later, to expand the ring in other ways.

I believe it could help, but this is YA case where it would have been nice to
have a dumb basic patch and this as a patch on top.  But I am going to ask
you to re-run that measurement, see if it stacks up (because it's an
interesting lesson if it does..)

Thanks!
Rusty.
