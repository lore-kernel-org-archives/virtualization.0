Hmm yes, I forgot about that.

The spec does not cover balloon.  It merely includes a reference section
about legacy balloon device.  What to do when that device sets VERSION_1
is really up to us.

Patchset v8 simply makes balloon tell core it's legacy_only.
This is I guess fine as far as it goes.
I was still looking for the best way that involves minimal noise
in core. This looked like the best way: change 4 lines,
and drop all special casing in core, but given the config space
endian-ness mess, I'm not sure anymore.
I guess we'll just stick to what v8 does for now.
