Yes it is. 

I just wanted to point out that you can use it until I'm awake enough to
implement it proper.

Right. But this applies only to deltas, as the conversion of absolute
time values gets ugly, i.e. 128bit math

IMO the paravirt interfaces should use nanoseconds anyway for both
readout and next event programming. That way the conversion is done in
the hypervisor once and the clocksources and clockevents are simple and
unified (except for the underlying hypervisor calls).

UNUSED:
The device is registered, but not used by any clockevents client

SHUTDOWN:
The device is registered, claimed by a clockevents client, but
momentarily not active.

The clock events device can treat UNUSED and SHUTDOWN basically in the
same way.
