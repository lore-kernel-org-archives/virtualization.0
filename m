Hmm, we do not want a buggy guest to be able to fill
host logs. This is only if debugging is enabled though, right?
We can also rate-limit the errors.

An approach I considered was to have qemu poll vq_err fd
and stop the device when an error is seen. My concern with
dropping a tx packet is that it would make debugging
very difficult.

I only see vhost_head_len returning skb->len. You are sure skb->len
includes vnet_hdr for tap rx?

I think it is legal for a guest to add buffers one by one.
My suggesting for handling this is to cache last value of available
index we have seen so that vhost_enable_notify returns
true if it changed meanwhile.

Care needs to be taken when index is changed with an ioctl.

OK then.

I presume under old code you mean some previous version of
merg. buffers patch? I don't see where current upstream would spin
waiting for guest (because a single descriptor is always
enough to fit a packet in), if we have this must fix ASAP.

Right. But what I suggested only copies the num_buffer.

Here I disagree. I think a single write to a buffer that
we know is in cache will be cheaper than a branch.
It's also less codelines :)

A 2 byte copy is almost free.

recvmsg updates at least the length.

Essentially, yes. Upstream code (move_iovec_hdr) assumes that header
size we might need to save is same as size we hide from backend,
but here it is different.  If we generalize move_iovec_hdr to something like
the below (warning: completely untested, likely has integer overflow
or other problems), then I think it will do what we want,
so that memcpy_toiovecend will work:

/* Copy len bytes, and pop the first pop_len bytes from iovec.
 * Arguments must satisfy pop_len <= len.
 * Return number of segments used. */
static int move_iovec_hdr(struct iovec *from, struct iovec *to,
                          size_t len, size_t pop_len, int iov_count)
{
        int seg = 0;
        size_t size;
        while (len && seg < iov_count) {
                size = min(from->iov_len, len);
                to->iov_base = from->iov_base;
                to->iov_len = size;
                if (pop_len > 0) {
                        from->iov_len -= size;
                        from->iov_base += size;
                        pop_len -= size;
                }
                len -= size;
                ++from;
                ++to;
                ++seg;
        }
        return seg;
}

Yes but we only need to update 2 bytes in userspace memory.
