You don't really, ACCESS_PLATFORM means just that, platform decides.

So as step one, you just give hypervisor admin an option to run legacy
systems faster by blocking secure mode. I don't see why that is
so terrible.

But as step two, assuming you use above step one to make legacy
guests go fast - maybe there is a point in detecting
such a hypervisor and doing something smarter with it.
By all means let's have a discussion around this but that is no longer
"to make it work" as the commit log says it's more a performance
optimization.

Not quite. It just means that hypervisor can live with not having
access to all memory. If platform wants to give it access
to all memory that is quite all right.

ACCESS_PLATFORM is there so guests can detect legacy hypervisors
which always assumed it's another CPU.

But swiotlb is just one implementation. It's a guest internal thing. The
issue is that memory isn't host accessible.  Yes linux does not use that
info too much right now but it already begins to seep out of the
abstraction.  For example as you are doing data copies you should maybe
calculate the packet checksum just as well.  Not something DMA API will
let you know right now, but that's because any bounce buffer users so
far weren't terribly fast anyway - it was all for 16 bit hardware and
such.

So don't. The way not to reflect that in the feature flags is
to set ACCESS_PLATFORM.  Then you say *I don't care let platform device*.


Without ACCESS_PLATFORM
virtio has a very specific opinion about the security of the
device, and that opinion is that device is part of the guest
supervisor security domain.

Let's say I have some doubts that there's an API that
matches what virtio with its bag of legacy compatibility exactly.

But taking a step back you seem to keep looking at it at the code level.
And I think that's not necessarily right. If ACCESS_PLATFORM isn't what you
are looking for then maybe you need another feature bit.
But you/we need to figure out what it means first.

Well you do have that luxury. It looks like that there are existing
guests that already acknowledge ACCESS_PLATFORM and you are not happy
with how that path is slow. So you are trying to optimize for
them by clearing ACCESS_PLATFORM and then you have lost ability
to invoke DMA API.

For example if there was another flag just like ACCESS_PLATFORM
just not yet used by anyone, you would be all fine using that right?

Is there any justification to doing that beyond someone putting
out slow code in the past?

Let's just say I don't think we should assume how the specific hypervisor
behaves. It seems to follow the spec and so should Linux.

I mean we can set a flag within struct virtio_device instead
of poking at features checking xen etc etc.

For legacy guests.
