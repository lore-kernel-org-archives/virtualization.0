Shortly after I sent the first email, we found that there is another
way to achieve this kind of communication, via KVM Hypercalls, I think
they are underutilised in kvm, but they exist.

We also found that they are architecture dependent, but the advantage
is that one doesn't need to create QEMU<-> kvm interface

So from our point of view it is either have things easily compatible
with many architectures out of the box (virtio) VS compatiability with
almost every front end including QEMU and any other one without
modification (Hypercalls)?

If it is the case, We might stick to hypercalls at the beginning,
because it can be easily tested with out modifying QEMU, but then
later we can move to virtio if there turned out to be clearer
advantage, especially performance wise.

Does that sounds like good idea?
I wanted to make sure because maybe maybe hypercalls aren't that much
used in kvm for a reason, so I wanted to verify that.
