The patches touch the Xen PCI components, so:

Acked-by: Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk <konrad.wilk@oracle.com>

And yeah, we need to update the MAINTAINERS file. Let me spin one out

Just as a note, you might want to create a branch titled

#linux-next in your git tree and link the reviewed/acked/tested branch to it. That way
Stephen does not have to change his entries in the linux-next tree every release.
