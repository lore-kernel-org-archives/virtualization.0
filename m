Hi Vivek!

IMHO, optimizing the synchronous path alone would justify the addition
of io_context in bio. There is more to this though.

As you point out, it would seem that aio and buffered IO would not
benefit from caching the io context in the bio itself, but there are
some subtleties here. Let's consider stacking devices and buffered IO,
for example. When a bio enters such a device it may get replicated
several times and, depending on the topology, some other derivative bios
will be created (RAID1 and parity configurations come to mind,
respectively). The problem here is that the memory allocated for the
newly created bios will be owned by the corresponding dm or md kernel
thread, not the originator of the bio we are replicating or calculating
the parity bits from.

The implication of this is that if we took the longer path (via
bio_cgroup) to obtain the io_context of those bios we would end up
charging the wrong guy for that IO: the kernel thread, not the
perpetrator of the IO.

A possible solution to this could be to track the original bio inside
the stacking device so that the io context of derivative bios can be
obtained from its bio_cgroup. However, I am afraid such an approach
would be overly complex and slow.

My feeling is that storing the io_context also in bios is the right way
to go: once the bio enters the block layer the kernel we can forget
about memory-related issues, thus avoiding what is arguably a layering
violation; io context information is not lost inside stacking devices
(we just need to make sure that whenever new bios are created the
io_context is carried over from the original one); and, finally, the
synchronous path can be easily optimized.

I hope this makes sense.

Thank you for your comments.
