Note that the proxy won't know anything about buffers if clients opt-in 
for zero-copy support (they allocate the buffers in a way that allows 
for sharing with the host).

Can you extend on this? I'm having trouble figuring out how this could 
work in a way that keeps protocol data together with the resources it 
refers to.

Yes, but at the same time there are use cases that virtio-vsock has to 
support but aren't important in this scenario.

A client will allocate a buffer with DRM_VIRTGPU_RESOURCE_CREATE, export 
it and pass the FD to the compositor (via the proxy).

During resource creation, QEMU would allocate a shmem buffer and map it 
into the guest with KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION.

The client would mmap that resource and render to it. Because it's 
backed by host memory, the compositor would be able to read it without 
any further copies.

When a FD comes from the compositor, QEMU mmaps it and maps that virtual 
address to the guest via KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION.

When the guest proxy reads from the winsrv socket, it will get a FD that 
wraps the buffer referenced above.

When the client reads from the guest proxy, it would get a FD that 
references that same buffer and would mmap it. At that point, the client 
is reading from the same physical pages where the compositor wrote to.

To be clear, I'm not against solving this via some form of restricted FD 
passing in virtio-vsock, but Stefan (added to CC) thought that it would 
be cleaner to do it all within virtio-gpu. This is the thread where it 
was discussed:
