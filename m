Well, paravirt must happen too, but comes later in this series, patch 3
which we're replying to is still very much in the bare metal part of the
series.

I've not had time yet to decode all that Waiman has done to make
paravirt work.

But as a general rule I like patches that start with something simple
and working and then optimize it, this series doesn't seem to quite
grasp that.

So, the advantage of one bit is that if we use a whole byte for 1 bit we
can avoid some atomic ops.

The entire reason for this in-word spinner is to amortize the cost of
hitting the external node cacheline.

So traditional locks like test-and-test and the ticket lock only ever
access the spinlock word itsef, this MCS style queueing lock has a
second (and, see my other rants in this thread, when done wrong more
than 2) cacheline to touch.

That said, all our benchmarking is pretty much for the cache-hot case,
so I'm not entirely convinced yet that the one pending bit makes up for
it, it does in the cache-hot case.

But... writing cache-cold benchmarks is _hard_ :/
