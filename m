You can always revert this patch in your tree, or whatever.  It does not
look like this will get fixed otherwise.

Yea, this hardware was designed by someone who thought mixing
LE and BE all over the place is a good idea.
But who said it should be easy?

Maybe this change will be enough to motivate the maintainers.

Here's a minor buglet for you as a motivator:

                        if (ct_rsp->header.response !=
                            cpu_to_be16(CT_ACCEPT_RESPONSE)) {
                                ql_dbg(ql_dbg_disc + ql_dbg_buffer, vha, 0x2077,
                                    "%s failed rejected request on port_id: %02x%02x%02x Compeltion status 0x%x, response 0x%x\n",
                                    routine, vha->d_id.b.domain,
                                    vha->d_id.b.area, vha->d_id.b.al_pa, comp_status, ct_rsp->header.response);


response is BE and isn't printed correctly.

another:

        eiter->a.max_frame_size = cpu_to_be32(eiter->a.max_frame_size);
        size += 4 + 4;

        ql_dbg(ql_dbg_disc, vha, 0x20bc,
            "Max_Frame_Size = %x.\n", eiter->a.max_frame_size);

printed too late, it's be by that time.

Here's another suspicious line

        ctio24->u.status1.flags = (atio->u.isp24.attr << 9) |
            cpu_to_le16(CTIO7_FLAGS_STATUS_MODE_1 |
                CTIO7_FLAGS_TERMINATE);

shifting attr by 9 bits gives different results on BE and LE,
mixing it with le16 looks rather strange.

Another:

                ha->flags.dport_enabled =
                    (mid_init_cb->init_cb.firmware_options_1 & BIT_7) != 0;

BIT_7 is native endian, firmware_options_1 is LE I think.



Look at qla27xx_find_valid_image as well.

        if (pri_image_status.signature != QLA27XX_IMG_STATUS_SIGN)

qla27xx_image_status seems to be data coming from flash, but is
somehow native-endian? Maybe ...


        lun = a->u.isp24.fcp_cmnd.lun;

I think lun here is in hardware format (le?), code treats it
as native.


Not to speak about interface abuse all over the place.
How about this:

uint32_t *
qla24xx_read_flash_data(scsi_qla_host_t *vha, uint32_t *dwptr, uint32_t
faddr,
    uint32_t dwords)                     
{
        uint32_t i;                     
        struct qla_hw_data *ha = vha->hw;
                                        
        /* Dword reads to flash. */
        for (i = 0; i < dwords; i++, faddr++)
                dwptr[i] = cpu_to_le32(qla24xx_read_flash_dword(ha,
                    flash_data_addr(ha, faddr)));

        return dwptr;                   
}

OK so we convert to LE ...

                qla24xx_read_flash_data(vha, dcode, faddr, 4); 
    
                risc_addr = be32_to_cpu(dcode[2]);
                *srisc_addr = *srisc_addr == 0 ? risc_addr : *srisc_addr;
                risc_size = be32_to_cpu(dcode[3]);

then happily assume it's BE.

And again, coming from flash, it's unlikely to actually be in the native
endian-ness as callers seem to assume. I'm guessing it's all BE.

I poked at it a bit and was able to cut down # of warnings
from 1700 to 1400 in an hour. Someone familiar with the code
should look at it.
