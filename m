This would be acceptable. It only needs a simple script to poke the correct
value, and that could be easily integrated into vendor scripts. The general
idea of being able to have a callback to userspace is okay but we'd like
something lighter weight for live migration, which is typically done only
within the scope of a single layer-2 network and hence all that is really
required is the gratuitous ARP to kick the switch hardware.
