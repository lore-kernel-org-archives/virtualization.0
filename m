It can't given that platforms have to implement it.  It is an arch hook
for dma-direct.

And your IOMMU can't deal with the encryption bit?  In the case we
could think of allowing IOMMU implementation to access it.  But the
point that it is an internal detail of the DMA implementation and by
now means for drivers.
