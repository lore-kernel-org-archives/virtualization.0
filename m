This doesn't work on s390.  It fails to link.

This was my initial thought, too -- it would be nice if s390 set up
no-op DMA ops its virtio device.  But this might be overkill, if
virtio is the *only* device on s390 that does anything that looks like
DMA.

Anyway, v2 (coming soon) adds a switch in virtio, so s390 should
continue to work.
