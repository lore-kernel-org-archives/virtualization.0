That seems unnecessarily complex.

This is why I've been pushing for the backends to be implemented in 
QEMU.  Then QEMU can marshal the backend-specific state and transfer it 
during live migration.  For something like copy/paste, this is obvious 
(the clipboard state).  A general command interface is probably 
stateless so it's a nop.

I'm not a fan of having external backends to QEMU for the very reasons 
you outline above.  You cannot marshal the state of a channel we know 
nothing about.  We're really just talking about extending virtio in a 
guest down to userspace so that we can implement paravirtual device 
drivers in guest userspace.  This may be an X graphics driver, a mouse 
driver, copy/paste, remote shutdown, etc.

A socket seems like a natural choice.  If that's wrong, then we can 
explore other options (like a char device, virtual fs, etc.).  This 
shouldn't be confused with networking though and all the talk of doing 
silly things like streaming fence traffic through it just encourages the 
confusion.
