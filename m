You're right, I meant Vp/Pp but they are invalid states.  I think one of 
the things that keeps tripping me up is that the host can change both 
the host and guest page states.  My initial impression was that the host 
handled the host state and the guest handled the guest state.

I was thinking that it may be useful to know a Ur verses a Uz when 
allocating memory.  In this case, you'd rather allocate Ur pages verses 
Uz to avoid the fault.  I don't read s390 arch code well, is the host 
state explicit to the guest?

Excellent!
