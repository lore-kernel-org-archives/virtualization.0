Yes I wrote stable@kernel.org that's what an old copy
says here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/stable_kernel_rules.txt

I should have known better than look at it on the 'net.  The top
'Everything you ever wanted to know about Linux 2.6 -stable releases.'
is a big hint that it's stale.
Any idea who maintains this? Better update it or remove it or redirect to git.
