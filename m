I am considering recoverable faults as the end goal, but reporting
unrecoverable faults should use the same queue, with slightly different
fields and no need for the driver to reply to the device.

The RESV_MEM regions only describes IOVA space for the moment, not
guest-physical, so I guess it provides different information than e820.

I think a useful example is the PCI bridge windows reported by the Linux
host to userspace using RESV_RESERVED regions (see
iommu_dma_get_resv_regions). If I understand correctly, they represent DMA
addresses that shouldn't be accessed by endpoints because they won't reach
the IOMMU. These are specific to the physical topology: a device will have
different reserved regions depending on the PCI slot it occupies.

When handled properly, PCI bridge windows quickly become a nuisance. With
kvmtool we observed that carving out their addresses globally removes a
lot of useful GPA space from the guest. Without a virtual IOMMU we can
either ignore them and hope everything will be fine, or remove all
reserved regions from the GPA space (which currently means editing by hand
the static guest-physical map...)

That's where RESV_MEM_T_ABORT comes handy with virtio-iommu. It describes
reserved IOVAs for a specific endpoint, and therefore removes the need to
carve the window out of the whole guest.

Yes I think adding MEM_T_IDENTITY will be necessary. I can see they are
used for both iGPU and USB controllers on my x86 machines. Do you know
more precisely what they are used for by the firmware?

It's not necessary with the base virtio-iommu device though (v0.4),
because the device can create the identity mappings itself and report them
to the guest as MEM_T_BYPASS. However, when we start handing page table
control over to the guest, the host won't be in control of IOVA->GPA
mappings and will need to gracefully ask the guest to do it.

I'm not aware of any firmware description resembling Intel RMRR or AMD
IVMD on ARM platforms. I do think ARM platforms could need MEM_T_IDENTITY
for requesting the guest to map MSI windows when page-table handover is in
use (MSI addresses are translated by the physical SMMU, so a IOVA->GPA
mapping must be installed by the guest). But since a vSMMU would need a
solution as well, I think I'll try to implement something more generic.

The behavior is left as an implementation choice, and I'm not sure it's
worth enforcing in the architecture. If the endpoint isn't attached to any
domain then (unless VIRTIO_IOMMU_F_BYPASS is negotiated), it isn't
necessarily able to do DMA at all. The virtio-iommu device may setup DMA
mastering lazily, in which case any DMA transaction would abort, or have
setup DMA already, in which case the endpoint can access MEM_T_BYPASS regions.

Thanks!
Jean
