Add multiqueue support to virtio network device.  Add a new feature flag
VIRTIO_NET_F_MULTIQUEUE for this feature, a +new configuration field
max_virtqueue_pairs to detect supported number +of virtqueues as well as
a new command VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_STEERING to +program packet steering.

Signed-off-by: Michael S. Tsirkin <mst@redhat.com>

Changes from v3:
Address Sasha's comments
- drop debug fields - less fields less to debug :)
- clarify max_virtqueue_pairs field and steering param field
- misc typos
Address Paolo's comments
- Fixed old rule name left over from v2
Address Rick's comment
- Tweaked wording

Changes from v2:
Address Jason's comments on v2:
- Changed STEERING_HOST to STEERING_RX_FOLLOWS_TX:
  this is both clearer and easier to support.
  It does not look like we need a separate steering command
  since host can just watch tx packets as they go.
- Moved RX and TX steering sections near each other.
- Add motivation for other changes in v2

Changes from Jason's rfc:
- reserved vq 3: this makes all rx vqs even and tx vqs odd, which
  looks nicer to me.
- documented packet steering, added a generalized steering programming
  command. Current modes are single queue and host driven multiqueue,
  but I envision support for guest driven multiqueue in the future.
- make default vqs unused when in mq mode - this wastes some memory
  but makes it more efficient to switch between modes as
  we can avoid this causing packet reordering.

If this looks OK to everyone, we can proceed with finalizing the
implementation.  This patch is against
eb9fc84d0d3c46438aaab190e2401a9e5409a052 in virtio-spec git tree.

+When VIRTIO_NET_F_MULTIQUEUE feature bit is negotiated, guest can use any
+ of multiple configured transmit queues to transmit a given packet.
+ To avoid packet reordering by device (which generally leads to performance
+ degradation) driver should attempt to utilize the same transmit virtqueue
+ for all packets of a given transmit flow.
+ For bi-directional protocols (in practice, TCP), a given network connection
+ can utilize both transmit and receive queues.
+ For best performance, packets from a single connection should utilize the
+ paired transmit and receive queues from the same virtqueue pair; for example
+ both transmitqN and receiveqN.
+ This rule makes it possible to optimize processing on the device side,
+ but this is not a hard requirement: devices should function correctly even
+ when this rule is not followed.
