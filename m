At least it's not what Michael initially thought should be done - IIRC.

"We need to remember that the whole HINT thing is not a mandate for host
to corrupt memory. It's just some info about page use guest gives host.
If host corrupts memory it's broken ...").

So the question remains: Does QEMU have a BUG or do we actually allow to
corrupt guest memory.

That leaves us with either

1. "Pages hinted via VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT might get replaced
by zero page. However, as soon as the page is written by the guest (even
before the hinting request was processed by the host), the modified page
will stay - whereby the unwritten parts might either be from the old, or
from the zero page." - a QEMU BUG.

2. "Pages hinted via VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT are considered
unused and will contain an undefined/uninitialized content once hinted.
As soon as the page is written by the guest (even before the hinting
request was processed by the host), the modified page will stay. The
guest should reinitialized the full page in case it cares about the
actual content (e.g., page poisoning)."


I tend to favor 2 - although it basically leaves no room for future
improvement regarding skipping re-initialization in the guest after
migration.

While it would be possible, I doubt it will be easy to implement, and I
still wonder if we should really care about optimizing an undocumented
feature that takes three people to figure out the semantics.

Right now, for simplicity, I prefer this and define
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON only for explicit deflation (balloon
deflation via the deflate queue) and implicit deflation
(VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_REPORTING).

Let's see if Michael has another opinion.
