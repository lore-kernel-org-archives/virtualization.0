What you mention is already included in 2.6.28 merge window.
I think we can use this feature on NVRAM, too.

I think it's not cgroup controller's role but each subsystem's one.
As you can see above article, Many mainline guys try to improve
performance in each subsystems.

Do you have a scenario or idea how to use cgroup frame work to manage
devices like NVRAM, SSD ??
