Well we have 256 descriptors per queue, each descriptor is 16 bytes
already and they have to be physically contigious.
I don't think we can easily increase the queue size much more without
risking memory allocation failures on busy systems.

I guess one approach is to do something like:
	 if (queue size > 1024)
		 use small buffers
	 else
		 use 4K buffers.

That would reduce the risk of regressions for existing users.
