Currently I have taken code from bio-cgroup to implement cgroups and to
provide functionality to associate a bio to a cgroup. I need this to be
able to queue the bio's at right node in the rb-tree and then also to be
able to take a decision when is the right time to release few requests.

Right now in crude implementation, I am working on making system boot.
Once patches are at least in little bit working shape, I will send it to you
to have a look.

Thanks
Vivek
