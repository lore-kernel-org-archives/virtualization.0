Ah, my mistake -- I was looking at 2.6.31 rather than latest git with
your patches.

I thought I had done so in my paragraph above, but if you would like
something a bit more formal...

	I, Paul E. McKenney, maintainer of the RCU implmentation
	embodied in the Linux kernel and co-inventor of RCU, being of
	sound mind and body, notwithstanding the wear and tear inherent
	in my numerous decades sojourn on this planet, hereby declare
	that the following usage of work queues constitutes a valid
	RCU implementation:

	1.	Execution of a full workqueue item being substituted
		for a conventional RCU read-side critical section, so
		that the start of execution of the function specified to
		INIT_WORK() corresponds to rcu_read_lock(), and the end of
		this self-same function corresponds to rcu_read_unlock().

	2.	Execution of flush_workqueue() being substituted for
		the conventional synchronize_rcu().

	The kernel developer availing himself or herself of this
	declaration must observe the following caveats:

	a.	The function specified to INIT_WORK() may only be
		invoked via the workqueue mechanism.  Invoking said
		function directly renders this declaration null
		and void, as it prevents the flush_workqueue() function
		from delivering the fundamental guarantee inherent in RCU.

	b.	At some point in the future, said developer may be
		required to apply some gcc attribute or sparse annotation
		to the function passed to INIT_WORK().	Beyond that
		point, failure to comply will render this declaration
		null and void, as such failure would render inoperative
		some potential RCU-validation tools, as duly noted by
		Eric Dumazet.

	c.	This declaration in no way relieves the developer of
		the responsibility to use this and other synchronization
		mechanisms correctly, again, as duly noted by Eric
		Dumazet.

(Sorry, but, as always, I could not resist!)

							Thanx, Paul
