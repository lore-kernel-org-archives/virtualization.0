It's far more complicated than that.  dhclient is part of ISC's DHCP 
package.  They do not have a public SCM and instead require you to join 
their Software Guild to get access to it.

This problem was identified in one distribution and the patch was pushed 
upstream but because they did not have a public SCM, most other 
distributions did not see the fix until it appeared in a release.  ISC 
has a pretty long release cycle historically.

ISC's had the fix for a long time but there was a 3-year gap in their 
releases and since their SCM isn't public, users are stuck with the last 
release.

This hack makes sense in QEMU as we have a few hacks like this to fix 
broken guests.  A primary use of virtualization is to run old 
applications so it makes sense for us to do that.

I don't think it makes sense for vhost to do this.  These guests are so 
old that they don't have the requisite features to achieve really high 
performance anyway.

I've always thought making vhost totally transparent was a bad idea and 
this is one of the reasons.  We can do a lot of ugly things in userspace 
that we shouldn't be doing in the kernel.
