Nod. Though if we want to require this for all devices,
virtio-blk scsi command passthrough will need to change -
I sent a spec patch a while ago
	virtio-spec: add field for scsi command size
any comments on it?

I think it's mostly doesn't fail in my testing.

It's probably a good idea to add a counter here, then
if it starts triggering we can optimize.

I think things like skb_header_cloned depend on guest config
really, e.g. tcpdump running on the interface in guest can cause this.

I think it will - copies are generally best avoided,
and header is easily 1K of data.

Needs some thought, though from experience it's a pain.
