So how doing this in stages:

1. add helper that checks skb GSO type.
If it is SKB_GSO_UDP, check for IPv6, and
generate the fragment ID.

Call this helper in
	- virtio net rx path
	- tun rx path (get user)
	- macvtap tx patch (get user)
	- packet socket tx patch (get user)

2. Put back UFO flag everywhere: virtio,tun,macvtap,packet,
since we can handle IPv6 now even if it's suboptimal.

Above two seem like smalling patches, appropriate for stable.

Next, work on a new feature to pass
fragment ID in virtio header:

3. split UFO/UFO6 as you did here, but add code
in above 4 places to convert UDP to UDP6,
additionally, add code in
	- virtio net tx path
	- tun tx path (get user)
	- macvtap rx patch (put user)
	- packet socket rx patch (put user)
to convert UDP6 to UDP.

	step 3 needs to be bisect-clean, somehow.

4. add new field in header, new feature bit for virtio net to gate it,
new ioctls to tun,macvtap,packet socket.

These two are more like optimizations, so not stable material.
