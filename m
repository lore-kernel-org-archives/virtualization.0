Well, that's not quite true.  The device could optimistically look
through the queue a bit for a small buffer; it does not need to consume
in order.  We'd probably want a feature bit for this.

I look forward to your thoughts on what mixing algorithm of different
sizes to use, of course.

Meanwhile, I suspect your patch works well because of 4k pages.  80%
non-GSO packets won't drop the average len below 4k.  On PPC64 with 64k
pages, that's not true.

I wonder if "last used len" would work about as well; it really might if
we had a smarter device...

Cheers,
Rusty.
