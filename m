Yeah, disable interrupts, and set a flag that the fake "sti" can test, and =

just return without doing anything.

(You may or may not also need to do extra work to Ack the hardware =

interrupt etc, which may be irq-controller specific. Once the CPU has =

accepted the interrupt, you may not be able to just leave it dangling)

But I was throwing that out as a long-term thing. I'm not claiming it's =

trivial, but it should be doable.
