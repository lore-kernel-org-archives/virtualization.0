The aim is to implement the API all through ioctls.

I've considered this approach, but what's the advantages of this? I mean
looks like all other ioctls could be done through vhost fd
reading/writing too.

I'm not sure I get the issue, current vhost API support setting
desc_user_addr, used_user_addr and avail_user_addr independently. So
looks ok? If not, looks not a problem to device IOTLB API itself.

It depends on guest working set I think. Looking at
http://dpdk.org/doc/guides/linux_gsg/sys_reqs.html:

- For 2MB page size in guest, it suggests hugepages=1024
- For 1GB page size, it suggests a hugepages=4

So I choose 2048 to make sure it can cover this.

Maybe.

The API does not require any alignment. Will add a comment for this.

Useless, will remove.

Will fix it.

Nope, my qemu patches does not use a dedicated thread. This API is used
to start or top DMAR according to e.g whether guest enable DMAR for
intel IOMMU.

Yes we need it. The feature bit is not considered in this patch and
looks like it was still under discussion. After we finalize it, I will add.

I believe it can just work like VERSION_1, or is there anything I missed?
