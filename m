I guess we could. Not sure what we'd do e.g. if that fails.

I'm not sure we ever understood it completely.

I think some of it has to do with the way the whole virtio 0
device register layout changes when you enable/disable MSI.  So should
be ok when using the modern virtio 1 model since we fixed this thing.

I was hoping that since disabling MSI in pci core is only useful as a
work-around (for devices with a broken bus master enable - even though I
don't think we know what these are exactly), a flag for not disabling it
won't be held to such a high standard.
