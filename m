Do you mean other virtual device driver transmit paths, like xen,
specifically?

Understood. Ideally we can remove the HoL blocking cause of this,
itself.

Interesting. I missed that. Perhaps the zerocopy optimization
could be gated on guest support for out of order completions.

True, but that is not set in stone. I went back and forth on that when
preparing fix 0a4a060bb204 ("sock: fix zerocopy_success regression
with msg_zerocopy"). The field can be moved outside the union and
initialized in the other zerocopy paths.
