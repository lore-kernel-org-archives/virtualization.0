I would like to have the other request_queue limitations exposed
here, too.
Most notably we're missing the maximum size of an individual segment
and the maximum size of the overall I/O request.
Without it we can't efficiently map onto pass-through devices.

As this is the host specification I really would like to see an host
identifier somewhere in there.
Otherwise we won't be able to reliably identify a virtio SCSI host.
Plus you can't calculate the ITL nexus information, making
Persistent Reservations impossible.
However, we should be able to delegate this to a specific controlq
command.

We should be adding

VIRTIO_SCSI_S_BUSY

for a temporary failure, indicating that a command retry
might be sufficient to clear this situation.
Equivalent to VIRTIO_SCSI_S_NEXUS_FAILURE, but issuing a retry on
the same path.

Thanks for the write-up.
