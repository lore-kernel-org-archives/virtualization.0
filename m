We've done that for a long time.  Real PIIX3 didn't have ACPI too, for
example (and it had a USB UHCI that is optional in QEMU).

Of course I'm not advocating adding the IOMMU to PIIX (assuming that
would work even just practically)... but I don't think adding interrupt
remapping to Q35 is a big deal.  It would be optional, just in case you
want to debug something without interrupt remapping, but it can be added.

In theory it's easy with the latest series.  All you need is support for
converting IOAPIC routes to KVM routes (and of course the glue code to
enable the capability and create the userspace devices); everything else
should work just by reusing the -machine kernel_irqchip=on code.  In
theory...
