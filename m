See my earlier reply [1] (but also, your WRC Linux example looks more
like a variant on WWC and I couldn't really follow it).

I couldn't make that leap. In particular, the manual's "Detailed
Description" sections explicitly refer to program-order:

  Every synchronizable specified memory instruction (loads or stores or
  both) that occurs in the instruction stream before the SYNC
  instruction must reach a stage in the load/store datapath after which
  no instruction re-ordering is possible before any synchronizable
  specified memory instruction which occurs after the SYNC instruction
  in the instruction stream reaches the same stage in the load/store
  datapath.
