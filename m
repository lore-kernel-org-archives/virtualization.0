From the same discussion thread: it would be good to expose stats
on the number of zerocopy skb sent and number completed without
copy.

To test this patch, I also added ethtool stats to tun and extended them
with two zerocopy counters. Then had tun override the uarg->callback
with its own and update the counters before calling the original callback.

The one useful datapoint I did not get out of that is why skbs would
revert to non-zerocopy: because of size, vhost_exceeds_maxpend
or vhost_net_tx_select_zcopy. The simplistic implementation with an
extra indirect function call and without percpu counters is also not
suitable for submission as is.
