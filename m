If a hypervisor needs this, and the guest doesn't support it, then
the hypervisor can only abandon the balloon device.  That's not my
definition of "optional".

That was left-field.... so you're saying some guest might pull a page
from the balloon and DMA to it, and the vfio device needs to know in
advance that it's going to do it?

But what will we do if the guest doesn't ack the bit?

ie. I don't think it can really be optional.

Cheers,
Rusty.
