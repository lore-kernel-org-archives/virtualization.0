This patch set is intended for the next merge window. They are just
enhancements of the already merged patches or ia64 porting from x86
paravirt techniques and that their quality is enough for merge.

This patch set is for binary patch optimization for paravirt_ops which
depends on the patch series I sent out, ia64/pv_ops, xen:
more paravirtualization.
The binary patch optimization is important on native case because
the paravirt_ops overhead can be reduced by converting indirect 
call into in-place execution or direct call.

The patch series does
- The first patch imports helper functions which themselves doesn't
  interesting things.
- The second patch replaces the indirect function calls with a special
  call written in gcc extended inline asm and introduces native methods.
- The third patch introduces binary patch for kernel modules.
- The forth patch suppress false positive warnings which were caused by
  the previous patches.
- The last patch implements xen methods.

thanks,

changes from take 2:
- removed trivial compilation error depending on .config

changes from take 1:
- no essential change from the last one
- rebased to 2.6.28-rc8
- don't use cmp_inst_t. define and use ia64_inst_t, instead.
- improve some assebmly code.
