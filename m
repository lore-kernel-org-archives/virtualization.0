yes, I wrote down something about the comparison of priority-based vs
bandwidth shaping solutions in terms of performance predictability.  And
other considerations, like the one I cited before, about dirty-ratio
throttling in memory, AIO handling, etc.

Something is also reported in the io-throttle documentation:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=121780176907686&w=2

But ok, I agree with Balbir, I can try to put the things together (in a
better form in particular) and try to post an RFC together with Ryo.

Ryo, do you have other documentation besides the info reported in the
dm-ioband website?

Thanks,
