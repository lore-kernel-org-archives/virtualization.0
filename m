Well, according to your reading of the spec.

In the spec I'm reading "Host must be told before pages from the balloon
are used".  Doesn't say anything about the guest.

Now, indeed a very free interpretation is "Guest will tell host before
pages from the balloon are used".  It turns out that it's exactly what
guests have been doing, hence that's exactly what I'm proposing now:
rename the feature to VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_WILL_TELL_HOST.

How so?

No, we don't!  Windows guests will just not be able to use munlock/mlock
until the driver is fixed.  Which will probably happen before someone
writes the munlock/mlock code.

Yes, that part we agree on I think.  We disagree that (after the rename)
QEMU should start always proposing VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_WILL_TELL_HOST.

_Plus_ adding the new feature bit, which is needed to actually tell the
driver that the host supports the silent deflate.  Spec patch on the way.
