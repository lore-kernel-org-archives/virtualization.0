I am not officially listed as a maintainer for Xen, but fwiw:

Acked-by: Dan Magenheimer <dan.magenheimer@oracle.com>

And, Stephen, I think Chris Wright and virtualization@lists.osdl.org
are stale entries in the MAINTAINERS file for Xen development,
so you are unlikely to receive replies from him/them.
(Chris, virtualization@lists.osdl.org ... please feel free
to correct me if I am wrong.)
