I don't really agree with this assessment.  There is no performance 
advantage to using a pure virtual bus.  If you have a pure pv device 
that looks and act like a PCI device, besides the obvious advantage of 
easy portability to other guest OSes (since everything support PCI, but 
porting XenBus--event to Linux 2.4.x was a royal pain), it is also very 
easy to support the device on other VMMs.

For instance, the PCI device that I just posted would allow virtio 
devices to be used trivially with HVM on Xen.  In fact, once the 
backends are complete and merged into QEMU, the next time Xen rebases 
QEMU they'll get the virtio PV-on-HVM drivers for free.  To me, that's a 
pretty significant advantage.

I have actually addressed this problem with a PV option rom for QEMU.  I 
expect to get time to submit the QEMU patches by the end of the year.
