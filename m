And when you say fair locks are you saying PV ticketlocks or generic
ticketlocks?

You should see the same values with the PV ticketlock. It is not clear
to me if this testing did include that variant of locks?

Right, the non-PV variant of them do fall apart. That is why
PV ticketlocks are so nice.

Ah, so it was non-PV.

I am curious if the test was any different if you tested PV ticketlocks
vs Red Hat variant of unfair locks.
