Isn't "nilal@redhat.com" Nitesh? Actually it's been cc-ed long time ago.

I think we should at least see the performance numbers and a working 
prototype from them (I remember they lack the host side implementation).

Btw, this feature is requested by many customers of Linux (not our own 
project's need). They want to use this feature to optimize their *live 
migration*. Hope the community could understand our need.

I think the above is a duplicate function of ballooning, though there 
are some differences. Please see below my concerns and different thoughts:

1) From the previous discussion, the only acceptable method to get pages 
from mm is to do alloc() (btw, we are not getting pages in this patch, 
we are getting hints). The above sounds like we are going to take pages 
from the free list without mm's awareness. I'm not sure if you would be 
ready to convince the mm folks that this idea is allowed.

2) If the guest has 8G free memory, how much can virtio-balloon take 
with the above method? For example, if virtio-balloon only takes 1G, 
with 7G left in mm. The next moment, it is possible that something comes 
out and needs to use 7.5GB. I think it is barely possible to ensure that 
the amount of memory we take to virtio-balloon won't affect the system.

3) Hints means the pages are quite likely to be free pages (no 
guarantee). If the pages given to host are going to be freed, then we 
really couldn't call them hints, they are true free pages. Ballooning 
needs true free pages, while live migration needs hints, would you agree 
with this? From the perspective of features, they are two different 
features, and should be gated with two feature bits and separated 
implementations. Mixing them would cause many unexpected issues (e.g. 
the case when the two features function at the same time)

4) If we want to add another function of ballooning, how is this better 
than the existing ballooning? The difference I can see is the current 
ballooning takes free pages via alloc(), while the above hacks into the 
free page list.


Best,
Wei
