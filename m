I hope you do not mind if I make some minor suggestions on how to
improve this nice documentation?

How about making this "On the other hand, now that there are also several
....good to add generic virtualization infrastructure to Linux/IA64" or
something alone these lines?

Here I suggest to say "a single kernel binary".

I am afraid this sentence does not completely translate.  Could this be 
written as "...is a set of function pointers and operations corresponding 
to low level sensitive instructions and high level functionalities in
various areas"?

How about making this "Some of these operations are very performance 
sensitive and indirect call overhead is not neglible".

Here, and in the other cases, we may want to consider saying "these
operations".

How about "...instructions.  They are called frequently and performance
critical"?

"a new machine vector"

"than"

I believe a "be" may be missing from the first sentence, and we may
want to say "in the native case".

How about making this "In fact, the Xen domU cases utilizes both
pv_ops and machine vector"?

"resulting"

I believe we can omit "part" here, and perhaps use "acceptable" instead
of "accepted".

Here and in the following entries I recommend saying "This structure
describes..." or just "This describes...".

"class of functions"

Wearing my GCC hat, "GCC" (all uppercase) is the preferred spelling,
but this is a most minor nit indeed.

"multiple", "definitions"

Have you considered using "or some other trick here"?

Thanks again for taking the time to write all this up, and I do hope my
comments appear useful!
