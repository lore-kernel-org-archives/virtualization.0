Both places where we call:

	cancel_delayed_work_sync(&vi->refill);

Do not actually guarantee that vi->refill isn't running, because it
can requeue itself.  A 'bool no_more_refill' field seems like the
simplest fix for this, but I don't think it's sufficient.

Tejun, is this correct?  What's the correct way to synchronously stop a
delayed_work which can "schedule_delayed_work(&vi->refill, HZ/2);" on
itself?

Thanks,
Rusty.
