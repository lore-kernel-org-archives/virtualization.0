I agree *except* that implementing it will be a real PITA and (I
think) can't be done without changing code in arch/.  My patches plus
an ifdef powerpc will be functionally equivalent, just uglier.

Bigger quirk: on a standard s390 virtio guest configuration,
dma_map_single etc will fail to link.  I tried this in v1 of these
patches.  So we can poke at the archdata all day, but we can't build a
kernel like that :(

So until the dma_ops pointer move into struct device and
CONFIG_HAS_DMA becomes mandatory (or mandatory enough that virtio can
depend on it), I don't think we can do it this way.

I'll send a v5 that is the same as v4 except with physical addressing
hardcoded in for powerpc.
