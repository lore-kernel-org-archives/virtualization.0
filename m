Yea, well - support for legacy BE guests on the new LE hosts is
exactly the motivation for this.

I dislike it too, but there are two redeeming properties that
made me merge this:

1.  It's a trivial amount of code: since we wrap host/guest accesses
    anyway, almost all of it is well hidden from drivers.

2.  Sane platforms would never set flags like VHOST_CROSS_ENDIAN_LEGACY -
    and when it's clear, there's zero overhead (as some point it was
    tested by compiling with and without the patches, got the same
    stripped binary).

Maybe we could create a Kconfig symbol to enforce point (2): prevent
people from enabling it e.g. on x86. I will look into this - but it can
be done by a patch on top, so I think this can be merged as is.

Or do you know of someone using kernel with all config options enabled
undiscriminately?

Thanks,
