It's not hard to try that:
1. revert c23f3445e68e1db0e74099f264bc5ff5d55ebdeb
   this will convert our thread to a workqueue
2. convert the workqueue to a per-cpu one

It didn't work that well in the past, but YMMV

On the surface I'd say a single thread makes some sense
as long as guest uses a single queue.
