Thanks for reviewing the patch and agree to move forward. Currently, I 
am thinking of separating out a PV and non-PV versions of the lock 
slowpath functions as shown in my previous mail. That should also 
minimize the performance impact on bare metal even more than what can be 
done with the PV techniques used in your patch while not penalizing PV 
performance.

As for the unlock function, if the site patching function can handle all 
the possible call sites of spin_unlock() without disabling function 
inlining, I will be glad to use your way of handing unlock function. 
Otherwise, I will prefer my current approach as it is simpler and more 
easy to understand as well as similar to what has been done in the pv 
ticket spinlock code.
