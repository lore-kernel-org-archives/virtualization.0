Pls copy virtio TC ML as with any interface change proposals.

Also pls use the correct list for virtio: that's
virtualization@lists.linux-foundation.org, not
virtualization@list.linux-foundation.org

And pls copy more relevant people directly.
virtio dpdk and qemu maintainers and qemu ml come to mind.

I'll try to look into interface detail later, but there's some
detail missing here on when are these extensions helpful.

Well it's harder for guest to get hold of random-ness.
why does doing it in host result in less randomness?

Consider vlan acceleration: it's normally done in hardware
but in our case isn't it just moving work over to
the hypervisor?

Some kind of performance improvement would have to be shown.

Sounds interesting. Again, is there a performance improvement to be
had from this?
