It is not about performance. It is about maintainability.

Err. We talk about paravirtualized Linux and not about what you have to
emulate to get Windows running. I don't care at all. Do you really
expect that we have to accept your design decisions, just because they
allow you to make your life easy ? This is exactly what you are using
paravirt ops for: a backdoor to throw your hackery at the kernel and
leave us with the mess of hardwired crap.

Again. You just refuse to change your implementation and you want to
keep it by arguing how hard it is because there are no abstractions.

I went through the business of creating abstractions into hardwired
hairballs twice. I know exactly what I'm talking about. It _IS_ hard
work, but at the end it makes the code better and more maintainable. You
do nothing for that, but expect that we live with your addons to the
hairball.

No it is not. #include <linux/smp.h> is an abstraction and
__send_IPI ... is the i386 low level implementation.

You insist to hook yourself into the low level code instead of hooking
into the high level code, because it is _YOUR_ implementation and we
have to accept it as is.

This is the completely wrong way. We get the same crap and discussion
for every other architecture we are going to support with paravirt ops.
And probably for every other hypervisor implementation, which has a
different way of doing things.

Waste of your precious time. I'm working on low level code and
abstractions and from now on I have also to take care not to break
_YOUR_ implementation. You are going to waste _MY_ time and I'm going to
fight that forever.

Your prayer wheel argument of missing abstractions and easiness of
emulating things is annoying. If you think it is better to emulate APIC,
please emulate it without paravirt ops. If you want the speed
improvement, work with us to create the interfaces and abstractions
which are necessary to have a sane, maintainable and useful for all
hypervisors implementation.
