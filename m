Available time is defined to be (real_time - stolen_time).  i.e. time in =

which the vcpu is either running or not ready to run [because it is =

halted, and nothing is pending]).

So, yes, it is per-vcpu.  But, the sched_clock() samples are rebased =

when processes are migrated between runqueues; search sched.c for =

most_recent_timestamp.  It's not perfect since most_recent_timestamp =

between cpu0 and cpu1 do not correspond to the exact same instant, but =

does prevent negative sleep time and is fairly close.
