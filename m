I was speaking generally, not specifically to Ira's architecture.  What
I mean is that vbus was designed to work without assuming that the
memory is pageable.  There are environments in which the host is not
capable of mapping hvas/*page, but the memctx->copy_to/copy_from
paradigm could still work (think rdma, for instance).

a) what about non-ethernets?
b) what do you suppose this protocol to aggregate the connections would
look like? (hint: this is what a vbus-connector does).
c) how do you manage the configuration, especially on a per-board basis?

Actually I have patches queued to allow vbus to be managed via ioctls as
well, per your feedback (and it solves the permissions/lifetime
critisims in alacrityvm-v0.1).

Also,

*) vhost is virtio-net specific, whereas vbus is a more generic device
model where thing like virtio-net or venet ride on top.

*) vhost is only designed to work with environments that look very
similar to a KVM guest (slot/hva translatable).  vbus can bridge various
environments by abstracting the key components (such as memory access).

*) vhost requires an active userspace management daemon, whereas vbus
can be driven by transient components, like scripts (ala udev)
