Hm.  I had a similar situation in the stolen time code, and I ended up
using signed values so I could clamp at zero.  Though that might have
been another bug; either way, the clamp is still there.

I wonder if cyc2ns might not be better using signed operations?  Or
perhaps better, the time code should endevour to do things on a
completely per-cpu basis (haven't really given this any thought).

I don't quite follow you here, but wouldn't setting the multiplier/shift
to 1/0 preclude being able to warp the clocksource with ntp?

Does the kernel expect the tsc clocksource to be completely monotonic
across cpus?  Any form of cpu-local clocksource is going to have this
problem; I wonder if clocksources can really only be useful if they're
always referring to a single system-wide time reference - seems like a
bit of a limitation.

I once had some code in there to do that, implemented in very boneheaded
way with a spinlock to protect the "last time returned" variable.  I
expect there's a better way to implement it.
