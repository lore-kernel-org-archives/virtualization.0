Ah right, I don't think the virtio-iommu device has to report the windows
of the emulated host bridge. RESV is useful for things that are not
obvious to the guest, for instance the physical PCI bridges that are
hidden from the guest.

It's an interesting point though, I can imagine non-Linux guest that are
not as well-equipped with dealing with things like PCI bridge windows, and
could benefit from the device reporting them.

In the end it is up to the device implementation to decide what regions to
report, and make sure that the guest is aware of the various traps in IOVA
space. For things like emulated bridges, the device can expect the guest
to find out about them. For physical bridges/SW_MSI of the host, it should
report the region and make sure that the guest doesn't map them. I'll add
a few more examples to the Implementation Notes, but I suspect reading
your Qemu source code will always be more helpful to people.

But the device has to know that it has a region that DMA transactions
bypass, right? If you want to implement MSI bypass, then you already have
to add a special case to your device code, and reporting it in a probe
shouldn't require a lot more work. For example, amdvi_translate() has a
special case for amdvi_is_interrupt_addr().

Yes

Do you mean reporting errors from device to driver? It's on the top of my
list, I might add it to v0.5 (without recoverable/PRI mode at the moment)

I can't, but I can get rid of the ack protocol and leave space if someone
needs to re-introduce it. I quite like it but don't think it'll be useful
to the few features I'm planning to add. A future re-introduction will
simply have to add a global feature bit VIRTIO_IOMMU_F_PROBE_ACK.

Note that the device isn't required to implement the ACK phase, we simply
give it a chance to verify that the driver understood its information. It
could simply check if the ACK bit is present and ignore the request in
this case.

Thanks,
Jean
