Nope. It does not. That's where the confusion is coming from.
TUN/TAP emulates _single_ network interface.
A better analogy of what TUN/TAP is is the "disconnected Ethernet port". It's
up to the application to simulate wire|loopback|another nic|etc.
Character device is simply a mechanism to reading and writing frames.
Application that uses TUN/TAP _may_ chose to treat the other end of it as
another network interface but TUN/TAP driver itself does not. Consider a
tunneling application like OpenVPN for example.
What you're describing is more like TAP (host) <-> TAP (guest) kind of thing.
ie Separate TAP instance for the guest.

See my explanation above. You came up with a bit different interpretation of
what TUN/TAP is which is not correct. With the proper TUN/TAP model in mind
your patch implemented filtering of the packets _transmitted_ on the TAP.
That's what I meant by the TX filtering.

If you see my first email on this thread I mentioned that the wrong set of
ioctls() was used in the original MC patch. Since most people think of the
TUN/TAP as the single device, Brian rightfully assumed that SIOCSIFHWADDR
sets the HW address of that single interface. ie It looks as if it's just a
short cut. Instead of having to open a socket, lookup TAP device and set HW
addr via the socket, application can just set it via TUN/TAP fd directly.

Also look at one of the comments in your original patch
        case SIOCGIFHWADDR:
                /* Note: the actual net device's address may be different */

In your TUN model the addresses _must_ be different. How can they be the same
if you're saying it's two different network cards ? That comment was incorrect
and confusing, it makes people think that it's kind of the same thing.
In fact it took me awhile to understand what it was that you were trying to do :).

Yep that too. It made me think that you're mixing TX and RX filtering.
Especially because net_filter was not used anywhere else.

So the correct way to do this is to clearly state that ioctl modifies TX
filters. ie Instead of using generic SIOCGIFHWADDR it should've been
TUNSETTXFILTER or something. And tun->dev_addr thing looks awfully similar to
the net->dev_addr. Again it should be tun->tx_filter_addr or something like that.

Anyway, do you have a use case for this stuff ?

I have a patch that cleans it all up. Looks like it might be useful for the
virt folks. Let me know what your use case was so that I could make sure it'd
still work. Unfortunately I'm going to have to replace existing SIOC* ioctls.
