Those were added to make sure there were no dangling references in the 
config_ops structure defined in those files and that the code calling 
through wouldn't go off into la-la land.  Perhaps it isn't necessary 
with Rusty's suggestion that I check ".bus_info" against NULL? But that 
is why those were there, and not simply the instance in virtio_pci.c. 
I'll spin a v2 regardless.
