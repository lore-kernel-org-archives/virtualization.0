host is the hypervisor?

Anyway, we would have to patch both kernels now anyway. :)

We still have a working ipv6_fragment routine in the virtualized kernel
which can embed fragmentation extension headers in frames, thus
generating the fragmentation id in the virtualized kernel.

It is the other way around:

(Source, Dest) is the key to lookup the next fragmentation id. We send
two fragments and use (Source, Dest, ifindex) as key, then the first
packet leaves the host on ifindex 1 with fragid x (because it was a big
gso packet it got segments), second packet leaves host on ifindex 2 with
same Source and Dest and results in fragid y. Ideally both those packets
should use the same bucket to improve uniqueness. Without ifindex we
would have y = x+<number segments>, otherwise it would be (I guess)
random.

No, they can't. But they should be reasonable unique and, as you said,
not discoverable.
