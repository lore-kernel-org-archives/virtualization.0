Does the SR/IOV spec guarantee that you will have such a separation?

Well the Shell does some sort of bonding (there are two links and the 
shell selects which one to exercise) and some sort of hotplug.  Since 
the Shell is part of the guest OS, you do rely on it.

It's certainly simpler than PCI hotplug or ordinary bonding.

How can you unmap the VF without guest cooperation?  If you're executing 
Plugin code, you can't yank anything out.

Are plugins executed with preemption/interrupts disabled?

What ISAs do those plugins support?
