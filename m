We only support in-kernel drivers, everything else is subject to changes
in the kernel API and ABI.  What you do is basically introducing another
wrapper layer not allowing full access to the normal Linux API.  People
have tried this before and we're not willing to add it.  Do a little
research on Project UDI if you're curious.

Yes, absolutely.  Just as we assume that for every other driver.

And that's not something we care about at all.  The Linux kernel has
traditionally a very hostile position against cross platform drivers for
reasons well explained before at many occasions.

Yes, of course it does.  It's a normal driver at the point which it
should have been from day one.

> [PT] Today this is tied to vmxnet3 device and is intended to work on ESX hypervisor only (vmxnet3 works on VMware hypervisor only). All the loading support is inside the ESX hypervisor. I am going to post the interface between the shell and the plugin soon and you can see that there is not a whole lot of dependency or infrastructure requirements from the Linux kernel. Please keep in mind that we don't use Linux as a hypervisor but as a guest VM.

But we use Linux as the hypervisor, too.  So if you want to target a
major infrastructure you might better make it available for that case.
