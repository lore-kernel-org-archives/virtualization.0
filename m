Why do you say that. This assignment is done in the probe function where the 
driver core is invoking the driver specific probe function. In the driver specific
probe function, I allocate class specific device state and embed the bus specific
device pointer. So, I would think the driver core is taking the appropriate reference
count. What I am doing is exactly what other PCI and virtio drivers are doing. For instance,
in virtio_blk.c , virtblk_probe() function, the virtio_device pointer is stashed away in the 
virtio_blk structure in exactly the same way I am doing. I suspect the assumption here is that
if probe succeeded, then the remove() function would be called to let the driver cleanup the state.

True. As I noted in an earlier email, the current hyper-v driver code has logic
to deal with the race conditions I have described. It is just that the current 
implementation is completely bogus - look at for instance the function
must_get_stor_device() in storvsc.c. This function is invoked in the channel
callback code path to process messages coming from the host. I added this lock
to close the window in getting the ext pointer. Clearly the lock protecting the 
ext pointer must be in a structure whose persistence is guaranteed and that is the reason
I put the lock in the struct hv_device.

What is being protected is the ext pointer that points to the class specific device state.
This state is freed when the driver is unloaded (in the remove function). The typical access
to the class specific device structure occurs given the pointer to bus specific device structure
struct hv_device. In the current code this transformation is done in functions such as
get_stor_device() and must_get_stor_device(). As you can see the logic in these function is 
broken since there are multiple windows. The lock I introduced was to close the windows I saw in 
these functions (similar functions exist on the netvsc side as well - get_inbound_net_device()
and get_outbound_net_device() in netvsc.c). I just tried to cleanup these functions with an easy to
understand logic to ensure the stability of the ext pointer.
