I'm going to bite the bullet and spend the next couple of days doing
just that: factoring out the VMCI bits and hiding them behind a
transport layer.  It'll be a bit rough, but it'll be a start.  We'll
submit another patch series next week with that.  I'm hoping that'll
get us over this hump, since it should by hypervisor agnostic at
that point.  It'll be up to you guys to add virtio, though :)

And in the meantime, are there any other glaring errors that we need
to address?

Thanks!
