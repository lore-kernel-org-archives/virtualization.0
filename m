The page is supplied to hypervisor and can lose the value that
is there.  That is the definition of writeable by device.

And then do what?

These should be split.

We have:

1. request that hypervisor sends to guest, includes ID: input
2. synchronisation header with ID sent by guest: output
3. list of pages: input

2 and 3 must be on the same VQ. 1 can come on any VQ - reusing stats VQ
might make sense.

See above. I would get requests on stats vq but report
free pages separately on free vq.
