Now this all is predicated on this actually mattering. :-)

You could argue that the scheduler as well as the size of the
TX queue should be limiting and enforcing fairness.

Someone really needs to test this.  Just skb_orphan() every packet
at the beginning of dev_hard_start_xmit(), then run some test
program with two clients looping out UDP packets to see if one
can monopolize the device and get a significantly larger amount
of TX resources than the other.  Repeat for 3, 4, 5, etc. clients.

That would also work.  And for the NIU case this would be great
because I DO have a marker bit for triggering interrupts in the TX
descriptors.  There's just no "all empty" interrupt on TX (who
designs these things? :( ).

Yes, but it means that teardown of a socket can be delayed up to
the amount of that timer.  Factor in all of this crazy
round_jiffies() stuff people do these days and it could cause
pauses for real use cases and drive users batty.

Probably the most profitable avenue is to see if this is a real issue
afterall (see above).  If we can get away with having the socket
buffer represent socket --> device space only, that's the most ideal
solution.  It will probably also improve performance a lot across the
board, especially on NUMA/SMP boxes as our TX complete events tend to
be in difference places than the SKB producer.
