As we discussed off-list, different guests may need wildly
different strategies. For example different queues for
different qos priorities might make a lot of sense.
So for now I'll remove the host-driven option and
add _GUEST (or maybe better name is _RX_FOLLOWS_TX)
rule which records the queue number on packet transmit and
uses that on receive.

Since guest handles one queue at a time during switch,
won't this mean host reorders packets even with a single queue?

I don't mind but this is also transmit related.

Problem with such approaches is, if we make them very generic they
will be slow (interpreter) or hard to implement (jit compiler).
I think rx follows tx above solves this neatly without
a lot of complexity.

Fow rx follows tx device needs to know how many tx queues
will be used.
Also I think it's good to be explicit and write up what
we expect driver to do rather than leave it to
drivers to interpret the spec any way they like.

Feature bits are negotiated at startup. Experience shows
there might be no ideal steering rule for all workloads
so switching them at runtime is needed.

So far your own performance results show there is no
ideal mode. And to me, this makes a lot of sense.
If you reset on switch this is very slow, so this basically means you
will forever rely on guest admin to know what the right thing to do is.
I agree it's a sensible thing to do in v1 but long term
an adaptive strategy requires that mode switch is lightweight.

It only seems like that. That's much more work for a driver to do, and
lots of races to avoid.  Just using vqs negotiated at startup is exactly
what all drivers currently do - it is much easier to do correctly.
