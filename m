Yes, 32 bit cid and port are defined by vSockets, we can not go for 64 bit
for virtio transport.

Yes.

Virtio transport stream data packets are a bit different from how VMCI transport
handles them. In VMCI, a dedicated queue pairs is created for each
stream. In virtio, all the streams share the single virtqueue pairs.

On the recv path, we need the cid and port information from the packet
header to figure out which socket is responsible for the packet.

Right, I wanted to follow how VMCI transport does the connection setup.

We can drop the IRTIO_VSOCK_OP_ATTACH stage, and make the client into
SS_CONNECTED state once we get the VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_NEGOTIATE pkt.
