OK, just so we track our mistakes.

1) virtio_rings must be physically contiguous, even though they actually
   have two independent parts.
2) The number of elements in a ring must be a power of 2.
3) virtio_pci tells the guest what number of elements to use.
4) The guest has to allocate that much physically contiguous memory, or fail.

In practice, 128 elements = 2 pages, 256 elements = 3 pages, 512 elements
= 5 pages.  Order 1, order 2, order 3 under Linux.  1 is OK, 2 is iffy, 3 is
hard.

Blocked from doing the simpler thing, we've decided to go with a layer
of indirection.  But the patch is simple and clean, so there's nothing
fundamental to object to.

I can't find 3/3, did it go missing?

Thanks,
Rusty.
