I understand your feelings about passing a chardev fd into your driver
and I agree that we need to be very careful if we want to allow it.

Maybe we could instead extend the 'splice' system call to work on a
vhost_net file descriptor. If we do that, we can put the access back
into a user thread (or two) that stays in splice indefinetely to
avoid some of the implications of kernel threads like the missing
ability to handle transfer errors in user space.

I think this could get more messy in the long run than calling vfs_readv
on a random fd. It would mean deep internal knowledge of the tap driver
in vhost_net, which I really would prefer to avoid.

yes, I understand that you can do that, but I still think that decision
should be left to user space. Adding a length header for TCP streams but
not for UDP is something that we would normally want to do, but IMHO
vhost_net should not need to know about this.

Right, I had forgotten about that one. It's probably equivalent
to the flags I suggested, except that one allows you to set features
after starting the communication, while the other one prevents
you from doing that.

So how about making the qemu command line interface an extension to
what Or Gerlitz has done for the raw packet sockets?
