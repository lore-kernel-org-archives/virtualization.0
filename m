There only seems to be a module description but no actual paramter for
this.  I wish people would have listened to me back then and made the
description part of the modular_param statement..

__RING_SIZE is not in my tree, so it seems to be some kind of Xen
addition.  Can you make that clear in the name and give it a less
awkware calling convention, e.g. only pass in the type, not a null
pointer of the given type?

This doesn't implement my review suggestion despite you ACKing
them.  Didn't you like it in the end or did you simply forget
about it?

no lines longer than 80 chars please.
