staging is not just for code that needs cleanups.
It's for anything that does not guarantee ABI stability yet.
And I think it's a bit early to guarantee ABI stability - 7 days
is not all that long.

See for example Anthony's comments that raise exactly the ABI
issues.

Once it's in kernel you never know who will use this driver.
Experimental does not mean driver can be dropped, staging does.

I do think upstream kernel would help you nail userspace issues too
but at this point it looks like either staging meterial or 3.6 is too
early.
