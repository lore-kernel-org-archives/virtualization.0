Yes, I meant the entire thing. I did infact turned WARN on w->lock==null 
before halt() [ though we can potentially have irq right after that ], 
but did not hit so far.

Had another idea if NMI, halts are causing problem until I saw PeterZ's 
reply similar to V2 of pvspinlock posted  here:

  https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/10/23/211

Instead of halt we started with a sleep hypercall in those
  versions. Changed to halt() once Avi suggested to reuse existing sleep.

If we use older hypercall with few changes like below:

kvm_pv_wait_for_kick_op(flags, vcpu, w->lock )
{
  // a0 reserved for flags
if (!w->lock)
return;
DEFINE_WAIT
...
end_wait
}

Only question is how to retry immediately with lock_spinning in
w->lock=null cases.

/me need to experiment that again perhaps to see if we get some benefit.

True.

Oops! sill me.

If you are doing it before

This was not the case. but latter is the one I missed.

  if you do it after then it is to late since interrupt can come

Yes, I tested with below as suggested:

//local_irq_restore(flags);

         /* halt until it's our turn and kicked. */
         if (arch_irqs_disabled_flags(flags))
                 halt();
         else
                 safe_halt();

  //local_irq_save(flags);
I am seeing only a slight overhead, but want to give a full run to
check the performance.
