This is possible but I wonder if this is really the way we should go.
It looks like you tried implementing another ioctl-like interface
on the cgroup control file interface. You can do anything you want
with this interface though.

I guess there should be at least some rules to implement this kind of
ioctl-like interface if they don't want to enhance the cgroup interface, 

Thank you,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
