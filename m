What I meant was guest users may create a virtual link, say veth that
has exactly the same MAC address as that for the VF, which can easily
get around of the binding procedure. There's no explicit flag to
identify a VF or pass-through device AFAIK. And sometimes this happens
maybe due to user misconfiguring the link. This process should be
hardened to avoid from any potential configuration errors.

Did you see my QEMU patch for using BDF as the grouping identifier?
And there can be others like what you suggested, but the point is that
it's requried to support explicit grouping mechanism from day one,
before the backup property cast into stones. This is orthogonal to
device model being proposed, be it 1-netdev or not. Delaying it would
just mean support and compatibility burden, appearing more like a
design flaw rather than a feature to add later on.

As Stephen said, Hyper-V supports the serial UUID thing from day-one.
It's just the Linux netvsc guest driver itself does not leverage that
ID from the very beginging.
