The function names are long enough already. Prefixing everything with kvm_ 
could hurt the eye as well.

Yes; it's going to trickle down soon.

It does keep everything nicely in one place though. You're right though. Some 
more attention is needed.

I was lazy and used the return value from here to propagate it down further. 
But this kicked me to modify that.

The error's going to the guest. The guest, as we know, has already done a 
successful DMA allocation. Something went wrong in the hypercall, and we 
don't know why (bad page). Any kind of error here isn't going to be 
intelligible to the guest anyway. It's mostly a host thing if we ever hit 
this.

We can't use atomic mappings for guest pages. They can be swapped out.
