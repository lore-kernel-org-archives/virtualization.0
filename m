Hi Gerd,

it's starting to look to me that we're talking a bit past the other, so 
I have pasted below a few words describing my current plan regarding the 
3 key scenarios that I'm addressing.

I mention below KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION, but I guess we can discuss 
alternatives such as the one you are proposing using PCI BARs at a later 
stage.

I really think that whatever we come up with needs to support 3D clients 
as well.


Creation of shareable buffer by guest
-------------------------------------------------

1. Client requests virtio driver to create a buffer suitable for sharing 
with host (DRM_VIRTGPU_RESOURCE_CREATE)

2. Virtio driver creates a new resource ID and passes the request to 
QEMU (VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_RESOURCE_CREATE_2D)

3. QEMU creates a shmem file (for example with mkostemp), associates 
that FD with the ID of this resource

4. QEMU maps that buffer to the guest's address space 
(KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION), passes the guest PFN to the virtio driver

5. DRM_VIRTGPU_RESOURCE_CREATE returns the resource id just created

6. Client mmaps it with DRM_IOCTL_VIRTGPU_MAP+mmap and can render to it

7. Gets a FD with DRM_IOCTL_PRIME_HANDLE_TO_FD that can be sent around


Send of shareable buffer by guest
---------------------------------------------

1. Client sends the host a message that refers to this buffer, passing 
the FD using SCM_RIGHTS

2. Guest proxy passes the message (serialized data + FDs) on to the 
virtio driver responsable for winsrv support

3. virtio driver puts the data and the resource ids corresponding to the 
FDs in a virtqueue, kicks it

4. QEMU pops data+buffers from the virtqueue, looks up shmem FD for each 
resource, sends data + FDs to the compositor with SCM_RIGHTS


Reception of buffer from the compositor
-----------------------------------------------------

1. QEMU reads from the socket and gets a FD via SCM_RIGHTS

2. QEMU mmaps the FD and maps the resulting pointer to the guest via 
KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION

3. QEMU sends the guest PFN along the presentation data to the virtio 
driver (VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_WINSRV_RX)

4. Virtio driver wraps a FD around that PFN, puts it in a queue

5. Guest proxy calls DRM_IOCTL_VIRTGPU_WINSRV_RX and gets data plus that FD

6. Guest proxy sends that data + FD to the client via SCM_RIGHTS

7. Client gets FD, mmaps it and reads the data from the compositor



Thanks,

Tomeu
