How does the throughput, latency, and host CPU utilization for normal
data path compare with say NetQueue?

And does this obsolete your UPT implementation?

How many cards actually support this NPA interface?  What does it look
like, i.e. where is the NPA specification?  (AFAIK, we never got the UPT
one).

How do you handle hardware which has a more symmetric view of the
SR-IOV world (SR-IOV is only PCI sepcification, not a network driver
specification)?  Or hardware which has multiple functions per physical
port (multiqueue, hw filtering, embedded switch, etc.)?

Can you demonstrate with data?

This can happen without NPA as well.  VF simply needs to request
the change via the PF (in fact, hw does that right now).  Also, we
already have a host side management interface via PF (see, for example,
RTM_SETLINK IFLA_VF_MAC interface).

What is control plane interface?  Just something like a fixed register set?

So we have a plugin per hardware VF implementation?  And the hypervisor
injects this code into the guest?

Yes, this is important, esp. instead of the requirement for hw to
implement a specific interface (I suspect you know all about this issue
already).

And it will need to be GPL AFAICT from what you've said thus far.  It
does sound worrisome, although I suppose hw firmware isn't particularly
different.

How does the shell switch back to emulated mode for live migration?

Please make this shell API interface and the PF/VF requirments available.
