If I didn't miss anything. In this case, for a specific rq,
napi_disable() won't return immediately since NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit was
still set. It will busy wait until NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit was clear by
virtnet_napi_enable(), and then reset the bit. So try_fill_recv() should
be called after its napi was enabled by virtnet_napi_enable() in CPU0.

So the following order were guaranteed:
- try_fill_recv(rq, GFP_ATOMIC) in CPU0
- virtnet_napi_enable(&vi->rq[i]) in CPU0
- napi_disable(&rq->napi) returned in CPU1
- try_fill_recv(rq) in CPU1
