I recommend following the proper naming scheme.  As this driver is
auto-loaded when the virtual hardware is seen, the name really doesn't
matter at all.

So, how about 'hid-hyperv' or 'hid-hv'?

That's not good for a very large number of reasons, not the least being
that we have no idea how secure the hyperv hypervisor is, so making it
so that there isn't an obvious hole into linux through it, would be a
good idea.

And yes, I'd say the same thing if this was a KVM or Xen driver as well.
Please be very defensive in this area of the code, especially as there
are no performance issues here.

That's great, but again, be defensive and at least have a "time out"
way to get out of this loop in case something goes wrong.  It will be
triggered some day, by someone, I guarantee it.
