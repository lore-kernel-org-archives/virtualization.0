It's hard to discuss without seeing the details, but we do need to
slow down guests that are flooding host with socket creation requests.
The handshake is a simple way for hypervisor to defer
such requests until it has resources without
breaking things.

I suspect in the end we will need a measure of fairness even
if you drop packets. And recovering from packet loss is
hard enough that not many applications do it correctly.
I suggest disabling SOCK_DGRAM for now.

I see David merged this one already, but above planned changes are
userspace and hypervisor/guest visible.

Once this is upstream and userspace/guests start relying on it,
we'll be stuck supporting this version in addition to
whatever we really want, with no easy way to even test it.

Might it not be better to defer enabling this upstream until the interface is
finalized?
