Sure.

I'm investigating this issuse currently, but with no much ideas. The 
aggregate transactions per second scales pretty well even with 20 
cocurrent sessions when doing test between a local host and a local vm. 
Looks like some bottleneck were reached when doing testing over 10gb or 
vms as even if I increase the number of sessions, the result would not 
increase.
