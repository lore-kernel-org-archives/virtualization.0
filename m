Well, this typing doesn't help here (like it rarely does). There are 
kvm-based setups that are stripped down and hardened in a way where 
other folks would rather think of "type 1". I just had a discussion 
around such a model for a cloud scenario that runs on kvm.

The point is in fact not only whether to trap IO accesses or to ask the 
guest to rather target something like ivshmem (in fact, that is where 
use cases I have in mind deviated from those of that cloud operator). It 
is specifically the question how the backend should be able to transfer 
data to/from the frontend. If you want to isolate the both from each 
other (driver VMs/domains/etc.), you either need a complex virtual IOMMU 
(or "grant tables") or a static DMA windows (like ivshmem). The former 
is more efficient with large transfers, the latter is much simpler and 
therefore more robust.
