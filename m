Kind of. In fact it will depend on cgroup hierarchy and dependent on
underlying scheduler.

I think once you start using WF2Q+ in common layer, CFQ will have to get
rid of that code. (Remember in case of CFQ, we will have a tree which
has got both task and groups as Scheduling Entity). So common layer code
can select the next entity to be dispatched base on WFQ2+ and then 
CFQ will decide which request to dispatch with-in that scheduling entity.

So may be we can start with bfq and try to break the code in two pieces.
One common code and one scheduler specific code. Then try to make use
of common code in deadline or anticipatory to see if things work fine. If,
that works, then we can get to CFQ to make use of common code. By that
time CFQ should have Fabio's changes. I think that will include WF2Q+
algorithm also (At least to provide faireness among taks, and not the
hierarchical thing). Once common layer WF2Q+ works well, we can get rid
of WF2Q+ from CFQ and try to complete the picture.

Agreed. any kind of tracking based on bio and not the task context shall
have to be done later, once we have come up with common layer code.

These are very vague high level ideas. Devil lies in details. :-) I will
get started to see how feasible the common layer code idea is.
