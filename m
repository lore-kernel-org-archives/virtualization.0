Well, by "additional problems" _I_ mean things like "a warning turned into =

a fatal oops and didn't get logged at all".

That's a lot more serious than "there were a few extra entries in the =

traceback that caused us some confusion".

And yes, we had exactly that case happen several times.

on the stack (and it's very obvious from the "<function+0>" ksymtab =

explanation: you can't have a <function+0> that is anything but a callback =

pointer (since it isn't a return address).
