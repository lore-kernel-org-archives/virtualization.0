By whom? Although I see some improved performance, I think its real
benefit is improving memory utilization on the guest. Instead of using
75K for an ARP packet, mergeable RX buffers only uses 4K. :-)

Actually, when the feature bit is disabled, it'll only get a single
head, doesn't use the special vnet_hdr, and the codepath reduces to the
essentially to the original. But the answer is "no"; I saw no regressions
when using it without the feature bit. The only substantive difference in 
that case
is that the new code avoids copying the vnet header as the original
does, so it should actually be faster, but I don't think that's measurable
above the variability I already see.

        The qemu code I have basically sends the set features and get
features all the way to vhost (ie, it's the guest negotiating with
vhost), except, of course, for the magic qemu-only bits. I think that's
the right model. I'll definitely take a look at the patch you mention
and maybe comment further.
