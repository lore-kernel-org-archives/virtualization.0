That's virtqueue_add_buf_single, that's a separate matter.
Another option for _single is just two wrappers:
virtqueue_add_buf_in
virtqueue_add_buf_out

Yes it does, if add_sg does not have in/out at all there's no way to
request the impossible to/from mix.

Yes but it's an important caller as all drivers besides storage use this
path.

Agree, bool is a bit ugly anyway.

I'm pretty sure we can do this without duplication, if we want to.

Yea, maybe. I'm not the API guru here anyway, it's Rusty's street.
