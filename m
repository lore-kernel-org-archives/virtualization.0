Hi Rusty,
Yes, I can't figure out an instance of disk probing in parallel either, but as
per the following commit, I think we still need use lock for safety. What's your opinion?

    [SCSI] sd: revive sd_index_lock

    Commit f27bac2761cab5a2e212dea602d22457a9aa6943 which converted sd to
    use ida instead of idr incorrectly removed sd_index_lock around id
    allocation and free.  idr/ida do have internal locks but they protect
    their free object lists not the allocation itself.  The caller is
    responsible for that.  This missing synchronization led to the same id
    being assigned to multiple devices leading to oops.
