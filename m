It's not about writing better code.  It's about having two completely
separate SCSI/block layers with completely different feature sets.

We could add hooks for vhost-scsi in the SCSI devices and let them
configure themselves.  I'm not sure it is a good idea.

To be clear, it supports -device for the virtio-scsi HBA itself; it
doesn't support using -drive/-device to set up the disks hanging off it.

It cannot support anyway the whole feature set unless you want to port
thousands of lines from the kernel to QEMU (well, perhaps we'll get
there but it's far.  And dually, the in-kernel target of course does not
support qcow2 and friends though perhaps you could imagine some hack
based on NBD.
