I am using ixgbe. From what I briefly saw, ixgbe_alloc_rx_buffers
calls skb_record_rx_queue when a skb is allocated. When a packet
is received (ixgbe_alloc_rx_buffers), it sets rxhash. The
recorded value is different for most skbs when I ran a single
stream TCP stream test (does skbs move between the rx_rings?).
With this patch, macvtap selects the same device for each
incoming packet. I can add some debugs in ixgbe to see what is
happening also. I am not sure if Sasha was using a different
device.

Cc'ing Jeffrey in case he can add something.

thanks,
