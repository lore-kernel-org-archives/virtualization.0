OK, I like the idea, but I'd prefer to see the spec only cover things
which are implemented and tested, otherwise the risk of a flaw in the
spec is really high in my experience.

s/total number of virtqueues/total number of request virtqueues/ ?

s/hints for scanning/hints to constrain scanning/ ? (I assume).  But why
mention the current values?  That doesn't help someone implementing a
driver or a device.  If you want to, you could mention that as an
implementation detail of your current implmentation, but it seems out of
place in the spec.

s/at least a/at least one/

Suggest simplification of second sentence:

It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure strict request
ordering; commands placed on different queues will be consumed with no
order constraints.

You keep saying "In this version of the spec".  I would delete that
phrase everywhere.

Be braver in your language please.  It helps poor implementers who are
already confused by learning SCSI and virtio:

 Task_attr, and prio must be zero.[1] task_attr defines the task
 attribute as in the table above, but all task attributes may be mapped
 to SIMPLE by the device; crn may also be provided by clients, but is
 generally expected to be 0.

 [1] Future extensions may use these fields.

Is it useful for a driver to specify ordered (or other) modes, knowing
it could be reduced to SIMPLE without it being aware?  Or should we use
feature bits to indicate what the device supports?

I think if you don't support ACA in the spec, don't define this.  How
will a driver author use this information?

With all these structures, you might want a comment indicating the
read-only and write-only (from the device POV) parts of the struct, eg:

     struct virtio_scsi_ctrl_an {
         // Read-only part
	 u32 type;
	 u8  lun[8];
	 u32 event_requested;
         // Write-only part
	 u32 event_actual;
	 u8  response;
     }

But basically, though I know nothing about SCSI, I like both the content
and style of this addition!

Thanks,
Rusty.
