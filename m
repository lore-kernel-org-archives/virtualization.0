Asuming you mean the Device Serial Number Capability,
I did consider this, and
we could use that, changing the UUID to one matching the
PV device, but I'm not sure no drivers will get confused
suddenly seeing the UUID of another company there.

If we are going the UUID route, a better idea might be to
specify the UUID of the PCI port into which the PT device is
being hotplugged.  This is PCI-Express specific, but presumably
legacy PCI/PCI-X devices aren't common enough to bother about
this for now.
