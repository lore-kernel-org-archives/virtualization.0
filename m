My understanding was that all three methods of obtaining entropy from
userspace all receive data from the CSPRNG in the kernel, and that the
only difference is that /dev/random and getrandom may block depending
on the kernel's estimate of the currently available entropy.

I agree, this is the documented behavior of getrandom.

I don't understand what this means. For my use case, hwrng is fed from
the host's urandom, so none of /dev/random, /dev/hwrng, /dev/urandom,
or getrandom with any flags in the guest should ever block except
possibly for very large amounts requested (megabytes at least).

I have been trying to explain the same problem the entire time. Let me
be clear what the problem is as I see it:

When qemu is started with -object rng-random,filename=/dev/urandom, and
immediately (i.e. with no initrd and as the first thing in init):

1. the guest runs dd if=/dev/random, there is no blocking and tons of
data goes to the screen. the data appears to be random.

2. the guest runs getrandom with any requested amount (tested 1 byte
and 16 bytes) and no flags, it blocks for 90-110 seconds while the
"non-blocking pool is initialized". the returned data appears to be
random.

3. the guest runs getrandom with GRND_RANDOM with any requested amount,
it returns the desired amount or possibly less, but in my experience at
least 10 bytes. the returned data appears to be random.

I believe that the difference between cases 1 and 2 is a bug, since
based on my previous statement, in this scenario, getrandom should
never block.
