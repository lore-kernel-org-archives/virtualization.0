Yes, let features -> less stuff to debug. I'll drop it.

This paragraph is there to address this:
	Driver selects an active steering rule using VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_STEERING
	command (this controls both which virtqueue is selected for a given
	packet for receive and notifies the device which virtqueues are about to
	be used for transmit).

How can I clarify this better?

I don't see separate steering as very useful:
it does not work for RX follows TX or for TX follows
RX, and separate commands imediately create lots of
options with behaviour which hard to define.
For example if you configure SINGLE on TX but RX_FOLLOWS_TX
on RX what does it mean?
