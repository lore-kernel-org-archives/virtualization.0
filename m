That's along the lines of what I was thinking as well.

The DT contains the address of GIC, timer etc as well right? So at least
in principal we needn't provide e.g. the GIC at the same address as any
real platform but in practice I expect we will.

In principal we could also offer the user options as to which particular
platform a guest looks like.

Right.

I think it likely that we can all agree on a common calling convention
for N-argument hypercalls. It doubt there are that many useful choices
with conflicting requirements yet strongly compelling advantages.

I'd not heard of this, maybe I just wasn't looking the right way though.
