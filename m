I always used O_DIRECT to test this patchset. And I mostly used raw 
block device as guest image. Is this the reason why I did not hit the 
problem you mentioned. Btw, I do have run this patchset on image based 
file. I still do not see problems like IO hangs.

I guess you mean this one:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=133312234313122

I did not notice that until James pointed that out.

I talked with Zach and Shaggy. Shaggy said he is still working on that 
patch set and will send that patch out soon.

Thanks, Jeff!

Yes. Will fix.

OK.

Yes. that's why there is a TODO.

Agree.

Sure. Let's wait for Shaggy's new version.
