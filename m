There is one other possible enhancement: we actually have the wait queue
lock taken in _wake_up, but we give it up only to take it again in the
handler.

It would be nicer to just remove the entry when we wake
the vhost thread. Re-add it if required.
I think that something like the below would give you the necessary API.
Pls feel free to use it if you are going to implement a patch on top
doing this - that's not a reason not to include this simple patch
though.

wait: add API to drop a wait_queue_t entry from wake up handler

A wake up handler might want to remove its own wait queue entry to avoid
future wakeups.  In particular, vhost has such a need.  As wait queue
lock is already taken, all we need is an API to remove the entry without
wait_queue_head_t which isn't currently accessible to wake up handlers.
