I've skimmed some more over the rest of the patches; but I think this
needs review by someone else.

For example, I'm not sure what the semantics of using the main css
device as the dma device are, as I'm not sufficiently familiar with the
intricacies of the dma infrastructure. Combine this with a lack of
documentation of the hardware architecture, and I think that others can
provide much better feedback on this than I am able to.
