Yes but I think that you want to put some controlled load on host.
Let's assume that we impove the speed somehow and now you can push more
bytes per second without loss.  Result might be a regression in your
test because you let the guest push "as much as it can" and suddenly it
can push more data through.  OTOH with packet loss the load on host is
anywhere in between send and receive throughput: there's no easy way to
measure it from netperf: the earlier some buffers overrun, the earlier
the packets get dropped and the less the load on host.

This is why I say that to get a specific
load on host you want to limit the sender
to a specific BW and then either
- make sure packet loss % is close to 0.
- make sure packet loss % is close to 100%.

Well I mean netperf on host.

Just to block netperf you can send it SIGSTOP :)
