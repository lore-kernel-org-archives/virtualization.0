Right, thanks for the clarification.

Hardware implementations of LRO which can't meet GRO rules are only
semi-useful, and that should be fed back to vendors.  Hard.

The VM needs to tell us it's OK with such mangling, otherwise we
shouldn't do it (at least by default).  The same way we'd be annoyed if
a card rev started doing LRO without the driver explicitly enabling it.

Cheers,
Rusty.
