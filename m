Okay, this will help to track anonymous pages even after processes are
migrated between memory-cgroups.
The rest of my concern is pages in the pagecache, which might be
potentially dirtied by processes in other cgroups. I think bio-cgroups
should also care this case.

Good news! But I've been wondering whether the IO controller should
have the same feature.
Once Kamezawa-san finished to implement the new page_cgroup
infrastructure which pre-allocates all the memory it needs,
I think I can minimize the cost migrating pages between bio-cgroup
since this migration won't cause any page reclaim unlike that of
memory-cgroup.

In this case I might design it only moves pages between bio-cgroups
while it won't move them between memory-cgroups.

Thanks,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
