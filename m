:)

I'm wondering whether we should still expect to hit the "ssch with
ena==0" situation, given that pm support has been removed again in the
meanwhile. (Well, other than in situations like this, where it is a
follow-up to other problems.) IOW, can callers expect not to see
-EINVAL, unless they are doing something really stupid?

Can't you zero the whole SCHIB, or do you still need some of the
measurement block things for cleanup?

I agree, I'd not expect to get -EINVAL in ccw_io_helper().
