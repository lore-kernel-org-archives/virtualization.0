Sorry Michael, that doesn't click. Yes of course virtio is implemented
in qemu, but the problem we are trying to solve is *not* a qemu problem
(the fact that the Linux drivers bypass the DMA API is wrong, needs
fixing, and isnt a qemu problem). The fact that the secure guests need
bounce buffering is not a qemu problem either.

Whether qemu chose to use an iommu or not is, and should remain an
orthogonal problem.

Forcing qemu to use the iommu to work around a linux side lack of
proper use of the DMA API is not only just papering over the problem,
it's also forcing changes up 3 or 4 levels of the SW stack to create
that new option that no user will understand the meaning of and that
would otherwise be unnecessary.

A guest bug then ? Well it wouldn't so much crash as force the pages to
become encrypted and cause horrible ping/pong between qemu and the
guest (the secure pages aren't accessible to qemu directly).

Again this is orthogonal. Using an iommu will indeed provide a modicum
of protection against buggy drivers, like it does on HW PCI platforms,
whether those guests are secure or not.

Note however that in practice, we tend to disable the iommu even on
real HW whenever we want performance (of course we can't for guests but
for bare metal systems we do, the added RAS isn't worth the performance
lost for very fast networking for example).

The DMA API itself isn't the one that needs to learn "per-device
quirks", it's just plumbing into arch backends. The "quirk" is at the
point of establishing the backend for a given device.

We can go a good way down that path simply by having virtio in Linux
start with putting *itself* its own direct ops in there when
VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM is not set, and removing all the special casing
in the rest of the driver.

Once that's done, we have a single point of establishing the dma ops,
we can quirk in there if needed, that's rather nicely contained, or put
an arch hook, or whatever is necessary.

I would like to keep however the ability to bypass the iommu for
performance reasons, and also because it's qemu default mode of
operation and my secure guest has no clean way to force qemu to turn
the iommu on. The hypervisor *could* return something to qemu when the
guest switch to secure as we do know that, and qemu could walk all of
it's virtio devices as a result and "switch" them over but that's
almost grosser from a qemu perspective.

Sure, then add a single platform hook and the platforms can do what
they want here.

But as I said, it should all be done at initialization time rather than
in the data path, this we absolutely agree. We should just chose the
right set of dma_ops, and have the data path always use the DMA API.

Cheers,
Ben.
