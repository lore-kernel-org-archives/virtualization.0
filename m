I'm doing net2VM tests (i.e. the traffic generator is on a different
host) with guest tuned a bit for performance. i.e. cpu pinning, no
iptables, no dhclient (yes, that makes a big difference:

Oops, I missed that invocation. Probably that path is not hit in my
test. I think it should be really worthy.

I'll send a v2.

The important thing, more than the current improvement, is allowing the
virtio_net driver to leverage future napi allocation improvement (i.e.
bulk alloc: http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg367568.html) which
should be a real win.
