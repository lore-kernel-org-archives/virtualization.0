You're right, I'm wrong.  In your original version, your innovative use
of free() then strdup() worked as intended.

I was referring to this:

	  return platform_device_register_resndata(&virtio_mmio_cmdline_parent,
			  "virtio-mmio", virtio_mmio_cmdline_id++,
			  resources, ARRAY_SIZE(resources), NULL, 0) != NULL;

The set function returns 0 or a -ve errno, not true/false.

Or would it be simpler to enhance sscanf() with some weird format option
for suffixing?  I haven't looked for similar cases, but I'd suspect a
big win in general.

This would be neater than anything else we've got:
        if (sscanf(device, "%llu@%llu[KMG]:%u", ...) != 3
            && sscanf(device, "%llu@%llu[KMG]:%u:%u", ...) != 4)
                return -EINVAL;

Cheers,
Rusty.
