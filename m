This is a pair of Xen para-virtual frontend device drivers:
drivers/video/xen-fbfront.c provides a framebuffer, and
drivers/input/xen-kbdfront provides keyboard and mouse.

The backends run in dom0 user space.

I started with the Xen version at
http://xenbits.xensource.com/linux-2.6.18-xen.hg?rev/ca05cf1a9bdc

Differences to that Xen version, for those who care:

* Rewritten on top of fb deferred I/O

* IRQ handler names visible in /proc and /sys match the driver names.

* Use framebuffer helper functions appropriate for framebuffer in
  system RAM.

* write() refreshes the framebuffer properly.

* off-by-one height of some screen refreshs fixed.

* Crash when register_framebuffer() fails fixed.

* Test for empty ring in input_handler() fixed.

* Deadlock in xen-kbdfront resume fixed.

* General clean up.

I have a step-by-step patch series from that Xen version to my
version, if anybody is interested.  Might be useful for reviewers
familiar with the Xen version.

The patch consists of two parts:

1. fbdev: Make deferred I/O work as advertized

   I need fb deferred I/O, but is utterly broken.  A fix has been
   floating around on linux-fbdev-devel as part of a larger patch,
   which as far as I know has not been merged anywhere, yet.  This is
   just the fix.

2. xen pvfb: Para-virtual framebuffer, keyboard and pointer driver

   The actual drivers.
