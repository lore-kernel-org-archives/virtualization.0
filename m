Hmm, I think page_cgroup's cost is visible when
1. a page is changed to be in-use state. (fault or radixt-tree-insert)
2. a page is changed to be out-of-use state (fault or radixt-tree-removal)
3. memcg hit its limit or global LRU reclaim runs.

"1" and "2" can be catched as 5% loss of exec throuput. 
"3" is not measured (because LRU walk itself is heavy.)

What new chances to access page_cgroup you'll add ?
I'll have to take into account them.

Overhead between page <-> page_cgroup lock is cannot be catched by
lock_stat now.Do you have numbers ?
But ok, there are too many locks ;(

Now, multi-sizer-page-cache is discussed for a long time. If it's our
direction, on-demand page_cgroup make sense.

ID can be obsolete, pointer is not. memory cgroup has to take care of
bio cgroup's race condition ? (About race conditions, it's already complicated
enough)

To be honest, I think adding a new (4 or 8 bytes) page struct and record infor
mation of bio-control is more straightforward approach. Buy as you might
think, "there is no room"
