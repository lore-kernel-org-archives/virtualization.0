Don't have the entire context here but if you implement the
ndo_fdb_dump() probably hooking it up to ndo_dflt_fdb_dump() you could
use the 'bridge' tool dump the uc_list.

Then use ndo_fdb_add() and ndo_fdb_del() to add and remove entries
from the uc_list. We do this today in macvlan and the ixgbe driver when
it is in SR-IOV mode and the embedded switch needs to be programmed.

fdb is "forwarding database" its a bit different then mac filtering
in that its telling the "switch" how to forward mac addresses, in
ixgbe and macvlan at least we have been overloading it a bit to also
stop filtering the mac address. I think this makes sense if you setup
forwarding to a port it doesn't make much sense to then drop them.

Maybe its not entirely applicable here just thought I would mention it.

Thanks,
John
