Alternatively, the IOMMU could be extended to allow an efficient
identity map of the entire physical address space.

For Xen.

On Xen, unless we do something quite kludgey, QEMU *cannot* bypass the
DMA API, and QEMU doesn't even know that Xen is there.  On Linux
kernels on Xen, the "physical" address (as returned by sg_phys, etc)
is not a real physical address.  The DMA API translates back and
forth.  Without using the DMA API, all of the DMA ends up in the wrong
place, and everything breaks.

We could teach the driver to bypass the IOMMU but to still use Xen's
mapping correctly, but that's complicated, and I think it serves
little purpose.  As I understand it, there is no reason to ever bypass
an IOMMU on x86, since x86 IOMMUs can be programmed to efficiently
identity map everything.  So, on x86, I think that the right long-term
solution is to just use the DMA API always.

There is a potential security issue, though.  If virtio-pci sets up an
identity map, then a malicious PCI device could pretend to speak
virtio and then take over the system using that identity map.  Using a
virtio capability here doesn't help, since a malicious device will
just set that capability to indicate that it should be identity
mapped.

I guess that we ideally want a secure way for the guest to distinguish
between three cases:

a) IOMMU should be used.
b) Device is trusted but the IOMMU still works.  The guest may want to
set up an identity map.
c) (PPC only) Device bypasses the IOMMU.  There's no security issue
here: a malicious device wouldn't be able to bypass the IOMMU, so it
would be unable to do DMA at all.
