Hi all:

This series tries to add basic busy polling for vhost net. The idea is
simple: at the end of tx processing, busy polling for new tx added
descriptor and rx receive socket for a while. The maximum number of
time (in us) could be spent on busy polling was specified through
module parameter.

Test were done through:

- 50 us as busy loop timeout
- Netperf 2.6
- Two machines with back to back connected mlx4
- Guest with 8 vcpus and 1 queue

Result shows very huge improvement on both tx (at most 158%) and rr
(at most 53%) while rx is as much as in the past. Most cases the cpu
utilization is also improved:

Changes from V1:
- Add a comment for vhost_has_work() to explain why it could be
  lockless
- Add param description for busyloop_timeout
- Split out the busy polling logic into a new helper
- Check and exit the loop when there's a pending signal
- Disable preemption during busy looping to make sure lock_clock() was
  correctly used.

Todo:
- Make the busyloop timeout could be configure per VM through ioctl.

Please review.

Thanks
