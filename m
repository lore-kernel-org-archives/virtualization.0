Because I told him to not do this. There's the fast path; the inline
single trylock cmpxchg, and the slow path; the out-of-line thing doing
the rest.

Note that pretty much all other locking primitives are implemented
similarly, with fast and slow paths.

I find that having the entire state machine in a single function is
easier.

Well, it increases the states and thereby the complexity, nothing to be
done about that. Also, its not a random heuristic in the sense that it
has odd behaviour. Its behaviour is very well controlled.

Furthermore, without this the qspinlock performance is too far off the
ticket lock performance to be a possible replacement.

We can try of course, but that doesn't help the code -- in fact, adding
the switch to turn if off _adds_ code on top.

Got a ref to documentation on this new fancy stuff? I might have an
IVB-EX, but I've not tried it yet.

That said, memory fetches are 100s of cycles, and while prefetch can
hide some of that, I'm not sure we can hide all of it, there's not
_that_ much we do.

If we observe the pending and locked bit set, we immediately drop to the
queueing code and touch it. So there's only a few useful instructions to
do.
