If you still can't understand what they are trying to do, they want to
do something precisely when the number of pending buffers is dropped
to 1 or less.

They are using krefs to track how many buffers are attached at a given
moment.

The counter can re-increment after the decrement to 1 or less occurs,
they don't care.

But they want precisely the entity that drops it down to 1 or less to
perform that action.

Just reading the atomic value directly, they cannot do this.
