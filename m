Yes, the idea behind ccw_io_helper() was to provide a simple way to use
the inherently asynchronous channel I/O operations in a synchronous
way, as that's what the virtio callbacks expect. I did not consider
multiple callbacks for a device running at the same time; but if the
interface allows that, we obviously need to be able to handle it.

Has this only been observed for the config get/set commands? (The
read-before-write thing?)

I'm for using more delicate tools, if possible :)

We basically have two options:
- Have a way to queue I/O operations and then handle them in sequence.
  Creates complexity, and is likely overkill. (We already have a kind
  of serialization because we re-submit the channel program until the
  hypervisor accepts it; the problem comes from the wait queue usage.)
- Add serialization around the submit/wait procedure (as you did), but
  with a per-device mutex. That looks like the easiest solution.

We probably still want to keep this while loop to be on the safe side
(unsolicited status from the hypervisor, for example.)
