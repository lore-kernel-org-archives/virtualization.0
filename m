I considered this, I was concerned that the usage isn't clear from name:
- this has to be called before VQs are used
- this is optional, happens automatically after probe

device_ready seems to imply driver is fully initialized,
if it was it could just call probe.

But it's easy enough to make the change, so I'll go ahead and
post V4. It will be up to you which one to apply then.

On kick? This seems too expensive, especially considering that
we don't track the status.

Anyway, can be a patch on top?
