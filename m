IMO, this makes a lot of sense because we now get a single definition of
VMW_PORT in the platform code that a developer can refer to to
understand things like 32-64 bit compatibilty, and usage conditions and
it also forces the developer to adopt the good practice of clearing
currently unused input variables rather than to leave them undefined. In
addition, if something needs to be changed we have one single place to
change rather than a lot of places scattered all over various kernel
modules.

Things that we (I) previously, for example, didn't get quite right in
the vmmouse module despite spending a considerable amount of time on the
subject.

Thanks,
Thomas
