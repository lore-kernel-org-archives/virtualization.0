Doesn't prevent it but it will delay it significantly
until scheduler decides to kick the VCPU task out.

In fact I don't really understand how it's supposed to
work at all: you only sync when ring is full.
So host may not have seen your map request if ring
is not full.
Why is it safe to use the address with a device then?
