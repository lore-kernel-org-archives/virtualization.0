This isn't really tied to hwrng_init() anymore, is it?

The problem with virtio-rng is that on a system with virtio-rng,
i.e. a kvm guest, it's most likely that there's only one hwrng device,
namely the virtio-rng, and when hwrng_register() is called in its
probe routine, hwrng_register doesn't have an old_rng, and will
proceed to call hwrng_init() and start using it.

So there's no second chance for the virtio-rng driver to finish its
probe and give the hwrng core an initial set of randomness.

As mentioned above, putting it inside init won't help, as that init
function will be called during probe itself by hwrng_register due to
no current_rng registered at that point.

I can't think of a solution that doesn't involve a layering violation
in the virtio code (i.e. set the DRIVER_OK bit in the probe routine;
the host is happy to service requests from such a driver and passes on
some randomness; and then reset that bit before probe() finishes).

Perhaps a re-work in hw_random/core.c could achieve this result for
virtio-rng, but that approach can't be valid for a -stable patch.
Perhaps a workqueue item that fires off the get_initial_randomness
function, which then sleeps till it receives a reply.  Then, the
'wait' param for hwrng_read() can be 0.

Thoughts?
