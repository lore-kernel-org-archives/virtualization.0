Right, I think current Linux guests are fine. The critical piece we are
talking about is

1) Guest balloon allocates and hints a page
2) Hypervisor does not process hinting request
3) Guest frees the page and reuses it (especially, writes it).
4) Hypervisor processes the hinting request.

AFAIU, as soon as the guest writes the page (e.g., zeroes it/poisons it
in the buddy, or somebody who allocated it), the page *will* get
migrated, even if 4) happens after 3). That's guaranteed by the 2-bitmap
magic.



Now, assume the following happens (in some future Linux version) (due to
your "simply not migrating it" comment):

1) Guest balloon allocates and hints a page. Assume the page is zero due
to want_init_on_free().
2) Hypervisor processes the hinting request.
3) Guest frees the page. Assume we are implementing some magic to "skip"
zeroing, as we assume it is still zero.

Due to 2), the page won't get migrated. In 3) we expect the page to be
0. QEMU would have to make sure that we always get either the original,
or a zero page on the destination. Otherwise, this smells like data
corruption.

I think, we should define valid ways for the hypervisor to change it.

"Pages hinted via VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT might get replaced by
a zero page. However, as soon as the page is written by the guest (even
before the hinting request was processed by the host), the modified page
will stay - whereby the unwritten parts might either be from the old, or
from the zero page."

I think the debatable part is "whereby the unwritten parts might either
be from the old, or from the zero page". AFAIU, you think it could
happen in QEMU, that we have neither the old, nor the zero page, but
instead some previous content. The question is if that's valid, or if
that's a BUG in QEMU. If it's valid, we can do no optimizations in the
guest (e.g., skip zeroing in the buddy). And I agree that this smells
like "data corruption" as Michael said.

Depends on what we think is the right way to do - IOW if we think "some
other content" as mentioned above is a BUG or not.

I think we have to define the valid semantics. That implies what would
be valid to do with it. Unfortunately, we have to reverse-engineer here.

The big question is, if we want to support VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON
with free page hinting. e.g.,:

"Pages hinted via VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT might get replaced by
a page full of X. However, as soon as the page is written by the guest
(even before the hinting request was processed by the host), the
modified page will stay - whereby the unwritten parts might either be
from the old, or from a page filled with X. Without
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON, X is zero, otherwise it is poison_val."

The current QEMU implementation would be to simply migrate all hinted
pages. In the future we could optimize. Not sure if it's worth the trouble.
