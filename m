Do you see a consistent degradation on the performance, or it only=20
happen when for during the beginning of the test?

I suspect we can do optimization in qemu side.

E.g send memtable entry via IOTLB API when vIOMMU is not enabled.

If this makes sense, I can draft patch to see if there's any difference.

Thanks
