See https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2009/09/11/decoding-the-dmar-tables-in-acpiiommu-part-2

I think that all that needs to happen is for ACPI to not list the
device in the scope of any drhd unit.  I don't know whether this works
correctly, but it looks like the iommu_dummy and the
init_no_remapping_devices code in intel-iommu.c exists for almost
exactly this purpose.

How?  If someone builds a physical device compliant with the virtio
1.0 specification, how do can that device know whether it's behind an
IOMMU?  The IOMMU is part of the host (or Xen, sort of), not the PCI
device.  I suppose that virtio 1.0 could add a bit indicating that the
virtio device is a physical piece of hardware (presumably this should
be PCI-specific).
