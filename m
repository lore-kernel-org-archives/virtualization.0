Hi Fernando,

I thought you did not get a chance to reply to this mail until today I found
your reply on virtualization list archive. (I am not on the virtualization
list). I am assuming that by mistake you just replied to virutalization list
or mail got lost somewhere.

https://lists.linux-foundation.org/pipermail/virtualization/2008-August/011=
588.html

Anyway, now I understand little better the issue at hand. Because cfq
retrieves the io_context information from the "current" and that can be
problematic in case of any software entitiy above elevator which buffers
the bio's and does some processing and then releases it to elevator. Two
cases come to my mind.

- Any stacked device driver
- I am also running into issues while I am putting all the requests on =

  an rb-tree (per request queue) before releasing them to elevator. I
  try to control the requests on this rb-tree based on cgroup weights and
  then release it to elevator. But I realized that cfq will get the wrong
  io_context information because of request buffering.

It then probably makes sense to put io_context information in bio and
let cfq retrieve it from bio instead of current. This way we will be able
to decouple the assumption that bio belongs to the thread submitting it
to cfq and will allow us to trap request and do processing and then sumit
to cfq without loosing io_context information.

Any kind of cgroup mechanism will also need to map a bio to the respective
cgroup. Because io_context is contained in task_struct, one can retrieve
bio->io_context and then task_struct from it and then find the cgroup
information and account the bio appropriately. But this assumes that
task_struct is still around but that might not be the case..... Any ideas?

Or may be we can go bio->page->pc_page->bio_cgroup->cgroup_id route but
that would not work very well in the case when stacked devices try to
replicate the bio. As you said memory of new bio will belong to some
kernel thread and accounting will not be proper.

That leaves me thinking...
