I do not think it is very rare to get interrupt between
local_irq_restore() and halt() under load since any interrupt that
occurs between local_irq_save() and local_irq_restore() will be delivered
immediately after local_irq_restore(). Of course the chance of no other
random interrupt waking lock waiter is very low, but waiter can sleep
for much longer then needed and this will be noticeable in performance.

BTW can NMI handler take spinlocks? If it can what happens if NMI is
delivered in a section protected by local_irq_save()/local_irq_restore()?

Yes, this is not what I proposed.

Use of arch_irqs_disabled() is incorrect here. If you are doing it before
local_irq_restore() it will always be false since you disabled interrupt
yourself, if you do it after then it is to late since interrupt can come
between local_irq_restore() and halt() so enabling interrupt and halt
are still not atomic.  You should drop local_irq_restore() and do

  if (arch_irqs_disabled_flags(flags))
	halt();
  else
	safe_halt();

instead.
