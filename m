Side note, you can certainly fix things like this at least in theory, but =

it requires:

 - the "call" instruction that is used instead of the inlining should =

   basically have no callee-clobbers. Any paravirt_ops called this way
   should have a special calling sequence where they simple save and =

   restore all the registers they use.

   This is usually not that bad. Just create a per-architecture wrapper =

   function that saves/restores anything that the C calling convention on =

   that architecture says is clobbered by calls.

 - if the function has arguments, and the inlined sequence can take the =

   arguments in arbitrary registers, you are going to penalize the inlined =

   sequence anyway (by forcing some fixed arbitrary register allocation =

   policy).This thing is largely unfixable without some really extreme =

   compiler games (like post-processing the assembler output and having =

   different entry-points depending on where the arguments are..)

.. it will obviously depend on how thngs are done whether these things are =

useful or not. But it does mean that it's always a good idea to just have =

a config option of "turn off all the paravirt crap, because it *does* add =

overhead, and replacing instructions on the fly doesn't make that =

overhead go away".
