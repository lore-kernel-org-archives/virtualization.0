I believe we do. We had discussions earlier in which Michael had
mentioned that the guest should not assume implementation details of
the host/hypervisor.

The PAGE_POISON feature is being used to indicate that we expect the
page to contain a certain value when it is returned to us. With the
current implementation in QEMU if that value is zero we can work with
it because that is the effect that MADV_DONTNEED has. However if there
were some other effect being used by QEMU we would want to know that
the guest is expecting us to write a 0 page. So I believe it makes
sense to inform the hypervisor that we are doing something that
expects us to fill the page with zeros in the case of
want_init_on_free rather than not providing that information to QEMU.
This way, if in the future we decide to change the implementation in
some way that might effect the value contained in the pages, we might
have the flexibility to identify the want_init_on_free case so we can
work around it.

In reality it isn't too different from informing QEMU that we are
performing poison with a value of 0 anyway which if I recall is what
led me to adding the want_init_on_free check as they are all lumped
together in free_pages_prezeroed():

Thanks.
