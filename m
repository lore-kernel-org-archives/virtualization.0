Why not?  Oh, I see.  intr_mask is inverted form of EFLAGS_IF.

I think Jeremy's idea was to have interrupt handlers leave interrupts 
disabled on exit if pda.intr_mask was set.  In which case, they would 
bypass all work and we could never get preempted.  I don't think leaving 
hardware interrupts disabled for such a long time is good though.

Yes.
