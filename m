ATM, the net driver does a pretty good job of disabling kicks/interrupts 
unless they are needed.  Checking for rx on tx and vice versa is a good 
idea and could further help there.  I'll give it a try this week.

Yes, after thinking about it over holiday, I agree that we should at 
least introduce a virtio-pci feature bitmask.  I'm not inclined to 
attempt to define a hypercall ABI or anything like that right now but 
having the feature bitmask will at least make it possible to do such a 
thing in the future.

Yes, paravirt_ops is attractive for abstracting the hypercall calling 
mechanism but it's still necessary to figure out how hypercalls would be 
identified.  I think it would be necessary to define a virtio specific 
hypercall space and use the virtio device ID to claim subspaces.

For instance, the hypercall number could be (virtio_devid << 16) | (call 
number).  How that translates into a hypercall would then be part of the 
paravirt_ops abstraction.  In KVM, we may have a single virtio hypercall 
where we pass the virtio hypercall number as one of the arguments or 
something like that.

:-)  Do you know if there is a hard limit on the number of devices on a 
PCI bus?  My concern was that it was limited by something stupid like an 
8-bit identifier.
