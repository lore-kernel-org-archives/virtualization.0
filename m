To understand whether it's bad, you'd need to measure it.
The netperf manual says:
	5.2.4 UDP_STREAM

		A UDP_STREAM test is similar to a TCP_STREAM test except UDP is used as
	the transport rather than TCP.

		A UDP_STREAM test has no end-to-end flow control - UDP provides none
	and neither does netperf. However, if you wish, you can configure netperf with
	--enable-intervals=yes to enable the global command-line -b and -w options to
	pace bursts of traffic onto the network.

	This has a number of implications.

	...
and one of the implications is that the max throughput
might not be reached when you try to send as much data as possible.
It might be confusing that this is what netperf does by default with UDP_STREAM:
if the endpoint is much faster than the network the issue might not appear.
