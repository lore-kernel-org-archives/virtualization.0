+		PCI Express Single Root I/O Virtualization HOWTO
+			Copyright (C) 2008 Intel Corporation
+			    Yu Zhao <yu.zhao@intel.com>
+
+
+1. Overview
+
+1.1 What is SR-IOV
+
+Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) is a PCI Express Extended
+capability which makes one physical device appear as multiple virtual
+devices. The physical device is referred to as Physical Function while
+the virtual devices are referred to as Virtual Functions. Allocation
+of Virtual Functions can be dynamically controlled by Physical Function
+via registers encapsulated in the capability. By default, this feature
+is not enabled and the Physical Function behaves as traditional PCIe
+device. Once it's turned on, each Virtual Function's PCI configuration
+space can be accessed by its own Bus, Device and Function Number (Routing
+ID). And each Virtual Function also has PCI Memory Space, which is used
+to map its register set. Virtual Function device driver operates on the
+register set so it can be functional and appear as a real existing PCI
+device.
+
+1.2 What is ARI
+
+Alternative Routing-ID Interpretation (ARI) allows a PCI Express Endpoint
+to use its device number field as part of function number. Traditionally,
+an Endpoint can only have 8 functions, and the device number of all
+Endpoints is zero. With ARI enabled, an Endpoint can have up to 256
+functions by using device number in conjunction with function number to
+indicate a function in the device. This is almost transparent to the Linux
+kernel because the Linux kernel still can use 8-bit bus number field plus
+8-bit devfn number field to locate a function. ARI is managed via the ARI
+Forwarding bit in the Device Capabilities 2 register of the PCI Express
+Capability on the Root Port or the Downstream Port and a new ARI Capability
+on the Endpoint.
+
+
+2. User Guide
+
+2.1 How can I manage SR-IOV
+
+If a device supports SR-IOV, then there should be some entires under
+/sys/bus/pci/slots/. The names of the entires are XXXX:BB:DD.F-iov-NNNN,
+where the first part (XXXX:BB:DD.F) is the domain, bus, device and function
+number of the device, and the third part (NNNN) is the index of a Virtual
+Function. There are three files under the entry: power, param and address.
+	- Writing 1 to the "power" will enable the Virtual Function,
+	and 0 will disable the Virtual Function; Reading it will get
+	status of the Virtual Function.
+	- Reading the "address" will get the bus, device and function
+	number of the Virtual Function.
+	- The "param" is the device specific parameters which may be
+	used by the Physical or Virtual Functions drivers.
+
+2.2 How can I use Virtual Functions
+
+Virtual Functions is treated as hot-plugged PCI devices in the kernel,
+so they should be able to work in the same way as real PCI devices.
+NOTE: Virtual Function device driver must be loaded to make it work.
+
+
+3. Developer Guide
+
+3.1 SR-IOV APIs
+
+To enable SR-IOV, Physical Function device driver needs to call:
+	int pci_iov_enable(struct pci_dev *dev, 
+			   int (*cb)(struct pci_dev *, int, int, char *))
+The pointer to the callback function could be NULL if Physical Function
+wants to ignore the events.
+
+To disable SR-IOV, Physical Function device driver needs to call:
+	void pci_iov_disable(struct pci_dev *dev)
+
+NOTE: these two functions sleeps 1 second waiting on hardware transaction
+completion according to SR-IOV specification.
+
+3.2 Usage example
+
+Following piece of code illustrates the usage of APIs above.
+
+static int callback(struct pci_dev *dev, int event, int arg, char *param)
+{
+	int err;
+
+	switch (event) {
+	case PCI_IOV_VF_ENABLE:
+		/*
+		 * request to enable a Virtual Function, setup hardware
+		 * resource to this Virtual Function if needed.
+		 */
+		break;
+	case PCI_IOV_VF_DISABLE:
+		/*
+		 * a Virtual Function has been disabled, reclaim hardware
+		 * resource if needed.
+		 */
+		break;
+	case PCI_IOV_VF_SETPARAM:
+		/*
+		 * parameter of a Virtual Function has been changed, take
+		 * corresponding actions if needed.
+		 */
+		break;
+	case PCI_IOV_VF_GETPARAM:
+		/*
+		 * return the parameters of a Virtual Function if any.
+		 */
+		break;
+	default:
+		return -EINVAL;
+	}
+
+	return err;
+}
+
+static int __devinit dev_probe(struct pci_dev *dev,
+				const struct pci_device_id *id)
+{
+	int err;
+
+	...
+
+	err = pci_iov_enable(dev, callback);
+	if (err)
+		return err;
+
+	...
+}
+
+static void __devexit dev_remove(struct pci_dev *dev)
+{
+	...
+
+	pci_iov_disable(dev);
+
+	...
+}
+
+#ifdef CONFIG_PM
+/*
+ * If the device supports the power management, then the SR-IOV
+ * may be disabled before the adapter goes to sleep, because
+ * Virtual Functions may not work when the adapter is in the\
+ * power-saving mode.
+ * The SR-IOV can be enabled again after the adapter wakes up.
+ */
+static int dev_suspend(struct pci_dev *dev, pm_message_t state)
+{
+	...
+
+	pci_iov_disable(dev);
+
+	...
+}
+
+static int dev_resume(struct pci_dev *dev)
+{
+	...
+
+	pci_iov_enable(dev, nvfs, callback);
+
+	...
+}
+#endif
+
+static struct pci_driver dev_driver = {
+	.name =		"SR-IOV PF driver",
+	.id_table =	dev_id_table,
+	.probe =	dev_probe,
+	.remove =	__devexit_p(dev_remove),
