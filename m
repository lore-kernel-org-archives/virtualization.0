There is nothing inherently racy about the config space. It is about the fact
that most PCI endpoint controllers:
1) Do not raise an interrupt when PCI BARs or config space is written by the
host RC, and
2) All PCI endpoint controllers that Linux supports do not allow drivers to
create extended capabilities in the config space that can then be emulated in
the endpoint driver (enabling that would require 1 to be supported, obviously).

(2) can be delt with quirks. Not great, but simple enough. And in this case, we
need it more because of the virtio-pci specs, which are not great to start with.

And for (1), the only real problem that causes is that an endpoint driver needs
to poll PCI BARs/submission queues to see if the host issued commands. Again not
great, but that works just fine. Alistair's point about burning a CPU doing that
is simply so that we can reduce command latency and get good enough performance.

We went through all of that already with the NVMe PCI endpoint. Works well
enough and does what is intended, which is the same here for the virtio-scsi
endpoint driver: create a platform where one can emulate a SCSI device to
experiment with new features etc. This is all intended as a development/test
tool, not for production use.

I do not know virtio-msg. First time I hear about it. And I am not sure if there
is a standard way of exposing a SCSI host through that.
