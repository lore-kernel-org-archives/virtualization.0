Especially if you want to support multiple architectures in the long
term, virtio is the way to go.

Design an architecture independent and extensible (+configurable)
interface and be happy :) This might of course require some thought.

(and don't worry, implementing a virtio driver is a lot simpler than you
might think)

But be aware that the virtio "hypervisor" side will be handled in QEMU,
so you'll need a proper QEMU->KVM interface to get things running.
