Yes, I did that now.

It might or might not be a good idea to add code in kvm_virtio.c
blacklisting VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1, just in case there's a buggy device
that sets it.
As correct devices won't set it, I don't think we need to
worry about it too much. We can make it a patch on top later
if we want.
