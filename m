Yes, I was worried that if we left the isr without actually handling the
interrupt, it would still be asserted and we'd just get interrupted
again.  The idea is that we avoid touching cli/sti for the common case
of no interrupts while interrupts are disabled, but we'd still need to
fall back to using them if an interrupt becomes pending.

How long?  It would be no longer than now, and possibly less, wouldn't it?
