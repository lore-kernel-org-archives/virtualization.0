I see, I didn't realize this. In light of this, is there any
guidance *how much* head room is required to be considered
valid? We already have 12 bytes of headroom.


I'm generally sorry it's taking long, a large part of that is difficulty
figuring out the requirements: when we discussed this on LPC my
take-away was that one of the first users will be fighting DDOS attacks.

In light of this, I assumed that
- supporting just DROP (or DROP+TX) would already be useful
- XDP_PASS shouldn't be too slow as some people will run all
  their traffic with XDP enabled
- people actually want this in virtio because they run in a vm

Since then I heard opinions that seem to imply that
- you must support all features, not just DROP, otherwise it's useless
- XDP_PASS is a slow path fallback as people are not expected to mix XDP
  with regular sockets
- DDOS protection and by extension XDP in virtio is a developer's toy anyway

Thus, expect some slowness while I figure it all out.
