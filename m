Hypervisor can do it too. And it really should:
specifying 2 devices as backup and giving them same mac
seems like a misconfiguration.

But it's easy to do in virtio without knobs - check
that the potential slave is also a virtio device with the
backup flag, and don't make it a slave.

Probably not.

I don't think it's possible to support this unconditionally.

E.g. think of a config where these actually share
a backend, with virtio becoming active when PT
access to the backend is disabled.

So you will need some device specific extension for that.

There is very little similarity. Calling this device a bond
just confuses people.

I'll take a look, but this isn't like a bond at all, no more than a vlan
is a bond.  E.g. if PT link goes down then link is down period and you
do not want to switch to virtio.

Existing HW won't have the BACKUP feature so the new functionality
won't be activated. So no problem I think.
