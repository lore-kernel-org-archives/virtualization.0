Hi, Andrea,

I'm working with Ryo on dm-ioband and other stuff.

The concept of dm-ioband includes it should be used with cgroup memory
controller as well as the bio cgroup. The memory controller is supposed
to control memory allocation and dirty-page ratio inside each cgroup.

Some guys of cgroup memory controller team just started to implement
the latter mechanism. They try to make each cgroup have a threshold
to limit the number of dirty pages in the group.

I feel this is good approach since each functions can work independently.

I guess it would make the memory controller team guys happier if you
can help them design their dirty-page ratio controlling functionality
much cooler and more generic. I think their goal is almost the same
as yours.

Thank you,
