Please, please, please do _NOT_ hide register numbers inside small
macros like this.  It makes it far too easy to miss register side
effects when looking at IA64 assembler code.  Instead make the register
usage a parameter to the macro, so a human looking at the source code
can see which registers are being used.  The macros in
include/asm-ia64/mca_asm.h are good examples of this approach.  IOW

#define ASM_READ_IVR(breg, greg) ... move greg=cr.ivr

	ASM_READ_IVR(breg1, gr24)	# make it obvious which registers are hit

For large macros like SAVE_ALL there is no choice but to hide register
side effects inside the macro, but that should be the exception, not
the rule.
