As far as I see, ixgbe and sfc have similar but much more sophisticated 
mechanism.

The idea was originally suggested by Ben and it was just borrowed form 
those real physical nic cards who can dispatch packets based on their 
hash. All of theses cards can filter the flow based on the hash of 
L2/L3/L4 header and the stack would tell the card which queue should 
this flow goes.

So in host, a simple hash to queue table were introduced in tap/macvtap 
and in guest, the guest driver would tell the desired queue of a flow 
through changing this table.
