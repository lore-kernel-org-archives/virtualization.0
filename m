I've been sending out this particular patch or a variant of it for a 
long time.  It did get lost for a while during the paravirt-ops 
conversion, however.  You're the first to give any feedback on it.

Better to keep what is known working for now, even if it is going to be 
replaced later... code is easy to change in development cycles, less 
easy to fix when nearing release.  It really is easy to mess up one of 
the pte conversions by, say, shift the wrong value or calculate wrong or 
PAE dependent PTE offset.  Plus it is harder to test, since you need > 
896 M memory for your VM before the code even gets run.

Not that I expect anything to go wrong with it, but I would prefer to 
err on the side of caution for now, that's all.
