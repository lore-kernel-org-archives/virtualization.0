No, I would think about starting a new driver file in "/drivers/net/".
The idea is this driver would be utilized to create a bond
automatically and set the appropriate registration hooks. If nothing
else you could probably just call it something generic like virt-bond
or vbond or whatever.

We all understand that. But you are making the solution very virtio
specific. We want to see this be usable for other interfaces such as
netsc and whatever other virtual interfaces are floating around out
there.

Also I haven't seen us address what happens as far as how we will
handle this on the host. My thought was we should have a paired
interface. Something like veth, but made up of a bond on each end. So
in the host we should have one bond that has a tap/vhost interface and
a VF port representor, and on the other we would be looking at the
virtio interface and the VF. Attaching the tap/vhost to the bond could
be a way of triggering the feature bit to be set in the virtio. That
way communication between the guest and the host won't get too
confusing as you will see all traffic from the bonded MAC address
always show up on the host side bond instead of potentially showing up
on two unrelated interfaces. It would also make for a good way to
resolve the east/west traffic problem on hosts since you could just
send the broadcast/multicast traffic via the tap/vhost/virtio channel
instead of having to send it back through the port representor and eat
up all that PCIe bus traffic.
