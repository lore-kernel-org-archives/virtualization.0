I think you could do much worse than just decide to pick the IO-APIC/lapic =

as your "virtual interrupt controller model". So I do *not* think that =

APICRead/APICWrite are in any way horrible interfaces for a virtual =

interrupt controller. In many ways, you then have a tested and known =

interface to work with.

Of course, there are bound to be better interfaces that map more naturally =

to what people actually want to *do* ("[un]mask interrupt pin X", =

"acknowledge interrupt pin X" etc), but quite often the cost of an =

interface is *designing* it, so I don't think it's wrong per se to just =

avoid that cost entirely, and just say "we make our interface look like a =

known hardware interface". And then IOAPIC/lapic is the obvious choice.

So Ingo, I think you've been a bit unfair. I agree that it would be =

ugly to also try to emulate timers with that "fake local apic" setup, but =

even that ugliness is probably not horrid, especially if you want to have =

some kind of stable interface for an ABI.

Of course the whole "stable ABI" is fairly moot. The kernel clearly won't =

use the ABI, but a source-level API - and part of that is *exactly* that =

an ABI is by design always very inflexible and has to be backwards =

compatible. Make the API more high-level, and then the VMI "paravirt_ops" =

stuff can translate that higher-level API into its own low-level ABI any =

way it wants to.

I do agree that for timers, the lapic model is probably ugly enough that =

an ABI might be better off with somethign cleaner than just seeing timers =

too as part of the interrupt controller, but I doubt it really is  that =

big a deal. And I really think Ingo has made a bigger deal out of this =

than necessary, although clearly CONFIG_NO_HZ will require that the =

paravirt_ops will work on that level and will be able to translate it to =

whatever VMI interfaces there are.
