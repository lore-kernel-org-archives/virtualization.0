At the moment Xen can't support guests with 2M pages.  In 32-bit this
isn't a huge problem, since the kernel doesn't assume it can map itself
with 2M pages.  But I think the 64-bit kernel assumes 2M pages are
always available for mapping the kernel.  I don't know how pervasive
this assumption is, but it would be nice to parameterize it in pv-ops.
