I appreciate your time in rewriting the code to make it easier to 
review. I will based my next patch on your rewrite. However, I am going 
to make the following minor changes:

1. I would like to series to be compilable with tip/master and v3.15-rc. 
Your patches seem to use some constants like __BYTE_ORDER__ that are not 
defined there. I will make change that to make them compilable on top of 
the latest upstream code.

2. Your patch uses atomic_test_and_set_bit to set the pending bit. I 
would prefer to use atomic_cmpxchg() which will ensure that the pending 
bit won't be set when some other tasks are already on the queue. This 
will also enable me to allow the simple setting of the lock bit without 
using atomic instruction. This change doesn't change performance that 
much when I tested it on Westmere. But on IvyBridge, it had a pretty big 
performance impact.

3. I doubt it is a good idea for the queue head to use atomic_cmpxchg() 
to pound on the lock cacheline repeatedly in the waiting loop. It will 
make it much harder for the lock holder to access the lock cacheline. I 
will use a simple atomic_read to query the status of the lock before 
doing any write on it.

I have no problem of making qspinlock the default for all x86 code.

Yes, using jiffies isn't the best idea, it is just an easier way. BTW, I 
don't need to reboot the machine to run my test, I only need to build 
the .ko file and use insmod to insert into the running kernel. When it 
is done, rmmod can be used to remove it. I do need to rebuild the kernel 
when I make changes to the qspinlock patch.
