I don't profess to know the real reason, but the only thing I can come up
with is a requirement/desire on some platforms for 16byte alignment
of the request structures.  This would make the largest possible structure
112 bytes, not the 120 that would allow for more elements.

While we're talking about fixing ring data structures, can RING_IDX
be defined as a "uint32_t" instead of "unsigned int".  The structure
padding in the ring macros assumes RING_IDX is exactly 4 bytes,
so this should be made explicit.  ILP64 machines may still be a way
out, but the use of non-fixed sized types in places where size really
matters just isn't clean.

The advertised max-ring-pages is sufficient to hold the maximum allowed
number of ring elements regardless of ABI.  This is then rounded up to the
next power of 2 pages to get the max-ring-page order.  When the front-end
negotiates, the backend just verifies that the maximum number of ring
elements in the specified ring size doesn't exceed the backend's limit.
Fortunately, even with this large of a ring, regardless of ABI, a given
page order computes to the same number of ring elements.  You just have
more wasted space.
