I think its really tricky.

Looking at where virtio came from, the virtio ring was always native access without
IOMMU. This was true for the early lguest things and then the early s390 transport,
(which is quite close to the lguest interface). virtio-pci used the same scheme
 - ignoring all iommu considerations.

I understand that for PCI we  actually might want to follow iommu restrictions from
a correctness and security point of view and from the ccw point of view we do not.
No idea about virtio-mmio.

I think the proper way of handling this is to take this into the TC for virtio - dont
know what would be the right thing to do. A feature bit, always iommu for pci, something
else?

Michael, Conny, 

do you agree?
