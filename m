Hi. I'm very glad to get reply.

Okay. Your question is quite reasonable and very good one.
In fact the current xen domU implementation is using both 
pv_ops and machine vector because it simplifies the code.
pv_ops somewhat overlaps with machine vector.

Our justification is as follows.
The difference is its scope. pv_ops for virtualization and
machine vector is for platform difference.

- pv_ops does cover the area which shouldn't belong to machine vector.
  For example, ia64 intrinsics paravirtualization.
  It shouldn't belong to the machine vector.
  It must be initialized very early before platform detection.

- pv_ops covers some performance critical part (e.g. ia64 intrinsics)
  so that in the future they should be optimized with binary patch like x86.
  We had the experimental patch to do that, but they are dropped for
  the merge. It reduced patch size greatly.
  After merging the first patch series, we're planning to optimize
  pv_ops with binary patch.
  The optimization with binary patch is out of the machine vector scope.

- The current pv_ops implements only one for only domU, but in future
  pv_ops will support dom0. It means dom0 linux would run with
  the underlying machine vector + pv_ops, i.e.
  {dig, hpzx1, hpzx1_swiotlb, ...} machine vector + xen pv_ops

Probably some hooks of pv_ops could be replaced with
enhancing machine vector. But from the above separating pv_ops from
machine vector looks reasonable.
Integrating pv_ops functionality to machine vector would complicate
the machine vector implementation unnecessary, I think.
