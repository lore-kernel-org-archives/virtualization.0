I suspect the diveregence will be lost on most users though
simply because they don't even care about vfio. They just
want things to go fast.

Rephrasing requirements in terms of acceleration actually
made things implementable. So I'm not in a hurry to try
and go back to asking for a migrateable vfio - very
easy to get stuck there.
