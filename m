You shouldn't be looking at any files, but rather calling programs to
get the information.  Think about systems with NetworkManager, and not
just the older Red Hat static scripts?  What about Gentoo and Ubuntu and
Arch and LFS and Slackware and SLES and Fedora?  You are quickly going
to go crazy if you are going to be mucking around looking in files for
things.

What exactly are you trying to do here?  That might be the better place
to start with instead of the implementation you have created.
