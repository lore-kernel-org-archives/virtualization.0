The notify stuff only applies to STREAMs.  However, we have two different
notify impls, one for legacy ESX and one for newer, and we figure out at
runtime which protocol we're using with the hypervisor and set the
callbacks appropriately.  The difference between the two is that the
newer one is much smarter and knows not to signal (the peer) quite so much,
i.e., it has some basic but sensible flow-control, which improves
performance quite a bit.  Again, that might not make any sense at all
for virtio.  Do you need to signal when you enqueue to a ring?  And is
there coalescing?  Dunno...

They were originally allowed to be NULL, but I changed it in the last
round of patches while moving them into the transport, since I disliked
the NULL checks so much.  I can put them back, but that's a bigger
change, and I'm not sure we want to push large patches to Dave right
now :)

> Which problem you are trying to tackle with the notifications?

It's to do with signaling the peer, or more appropriately, trying to
avoid signaling the peer when possible.  The naive impl. is to signal
every time we enqueue or dequeue data (into our VMCI queuepairs).
But signaling is slow, since it involves a world exit, so we prefer
not to.  Which means we need to keep track of rate of flow and figure
out when we should and should not, and that's what all the notification
stuff does.  It's...ugly...

Hrm, lemme think about this one.

Sure.

Avoiding allocation is good, but at the same time, I wonder if it's not
a big deal compared with the time spent copying out of the buffers, in
which case it won't matter.  So maybe we can do this.

Thanks!
