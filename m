Yes, if you add a check for the original source port on broadcast/
multicast delivery, then macvlan would be able to function in
basic VEPA mode. 

Maybe it might still be worth preserving the old behaviour, and 
just add an explicit VEPA mode.

Looking through the discussions here, it does not seem as if a decision
was made to integrate those patches, because they would make the macvlan
interface behave too much like a bridge. Also, it seems as if there was 
still a problem with doing multicast/broadcast delivery when enabling
local VM-to-VM communication. Is that solved by now?

Thanks,
Anna
