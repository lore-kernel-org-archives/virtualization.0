I've actually already pushed this patch to RHEL-7 (just before 7.5 was 
released) and it found out some powerpc issues. See the commit 
ea376cc55bc3 in the RHEL-7 git. It was reverted just before RHEL-7.5 was 
released with the intention that it will be reinstated just after RHEL-7.5 
release, so that these issues could be found and eliminated in the 
7.5->7.6 development cycle. Jeff Moyer asked me to put it upstream because 
they want to follow upstream and they don't like RHEL-specific patches. 
There's clear incentive to put this patch to RHEL-7, that's why I'm 
posting it here.

But the problem is that the powerpc bug only triggers with this patch. It 
doesn't trigger without it. So, we have a potential random-crashing bug in 
the codebase (and perhaps more others) and we want to eliminate them - 
that's why we need the patch.

People on this list argue "this should be a kernel parameter". But the 
testers won't enable the kernel parameter, the crashes won't happen 
without the kernel parameter and the bugs will stay unreported and 
uncorrected. That's why it needs to be the default.
