Yeah, that sounds much better - a minor detail is that it'd be better to
hang the symlink off each virtio implementation's root object rather
than off each device.

To that end, I've hacked up register_virtio_root_device() which fixes
the fact that we statically allocate root objects and gives us a sane
place to add this generic symlink.

It might make sense to add this to the core, though - e.g.
device_register_root() - and that would also allow us use the same
approach as module_add_driver() to add the module symlink for built-in
modules.

Cheers,
Mark.
