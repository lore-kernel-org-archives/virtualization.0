Great, you can delete it.

I have a few comments about this, I'll respond in another email.

Sure, you can delete it.

Leave that until the network subsystem authors agree that this is all
taken care of by merging the driver into their subsystem.

Same as above for the network driver, but you can leave just one entry
now.

I can't apply patches right now due to the kernel.org infrastructure
reworking, so you will have to wait a few days for me to apply your
previous ones, but feel free to send a patch cleaning up the TODO file
now.
