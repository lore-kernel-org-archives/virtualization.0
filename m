Exactly! We have a lot of legacy herritage and random semantic because
we were too eager to merge stuff. I think it is time to stop that and
think twice before merging someothing. If you call that evil then I am
fine to be evil.

It was basically to detect GFP_NOIO context _inside_ vmalloc and use the
scope API to enforce it there. Does it solve potential problems? Yes it
does. Does it solve any existing report, no I am not aware of any. Is
it a good fix longterm? Absolutely no, because the scope API should be
used _at the place_ where the scope starts rather than a random utility
function. If we are going the easier way now, we will never teach users
to use the API properly. And I am willing to risk to keep a broken
code which we have for years rather than allow a random hack that will
seemingly fix it.

Btw. I was pretty much explicit with this reasoning when rejecting the
patch. Do you still call that evil?

I do not remember that one but __GFP_NORETRY is _allowed_ to sleep. And
yes I do _agree_ gfp flags are a mess which is really hard to get fixed
because they are lacking a good design from the very beginning. Fixing
some of those issues today is a completely PITA.

And again, it is way much more easier to claim that something will get
fixed when the reality is much more complicated. I've tried to explain
those risks as well.

And look here. This is yet another ad-hoc idea. We have many users of
kvmalloc which have no relation to SG, yet you are going to control
their behavior by CONFIG_DEBUG_SG? No way! (yeah evil again)

Really, we have a fault injection framework and this sounds like
something to hook in there.
