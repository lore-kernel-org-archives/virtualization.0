The current PPC paravirt spinlock code doesn't do any cpu kick. It does 
an equivalence of pv_wait by yielding the cpu to the lock holder only. 
The pv_spinlocks_init() is for setting up the hash table for doing 
pv_kick. If we don't need to do pv_kick, we don't need the hash table.

I am not saying that pv_kick is not needed for the PPC environment. I 
was just trying to adapt the pvqspinlock code to such an environment 
first. Further investigation on how to implement some kind of pv_kick 
will be something that we may want to do as a follow on.

BTW, do you have any comment on my v2 lock holder cpu info qspinlock 
patch? I will have to update the patch to fix the reported 0-day test 
problem, but I want to collect other feedback before sending out v3.

Cheers,
Longman
