I was thinking more of entry.S rather than inline asms.  The only ones I
can think of which would be relevant are the interrupt operations in
spinlocks, and even then we get a bit more leeway.

Right, I'm not making any assumptions about what gcc generates for
calls, other than assuming it uses a standard "call X" direct call
instruction.

No, my intention is that the vast majority of pv_ops uses, which are
calls from C code, would simply be normal C calls, syntatically and
semantically.

I think the main value is retaining non-PARAVIRT native performance
levels.  In the native case, the inlined instructions amount to 1 or 2
bytes, and having small patch sites is an advantage because there's less
space wasted on nops.  My understanding is that a direct call has almost
zero overhead on modern processors, because both the call and the return
can be completely predicted and prefetched, so the threshhold at which
you make inline vs call tradeoff is pretty small.

There are also the ones in entry.S.  I suppose spinlocks do get used
more than syscalls and interrupts.
