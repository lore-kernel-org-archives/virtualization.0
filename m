That works.  I don't expect we'll need more than 64 features given that
virtio_net hasn't seen a new one in over a year, but it's gone from 5 to
18 in 4 years, so another 32 bits at that rate only gets us another decade.

Unfortunately, it doesn't solve the queue_address problem.

We currently multiply the (32-bit) address by 4096 (the alignment).  If
drivers are going to reduce alignment, that makes it trickier, hence the
change here to a 64.  Simplicity.

We could cheat and assert that a 32-bit write there implies 0 in the
upper bits, and hope that all 64 bit platforms can do a 64-bit atomic
write.  Or insist the value not be intepreted until the guest writes its
(first) feature bit.

Perhaps we really need a "I'm done configuring!" trigger, now we can't
use the feature bit field for that.

Thoughts welcome...
Rusty.
