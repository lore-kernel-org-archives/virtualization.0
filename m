Yes, this is one of the problems linux kernel still has, which should
be solved.

But I believe this should be done in the linux memory management layer
including the cgroup memory controller, which has to work correctly
on any type of device with various access speeds.

I think it's better that I/O controllers should only focus on flow of
I/O requests. This approach will keep the implementation of linux
kernel simple.

Thank you,
