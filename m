I was thinking only a read followed by write will needs to stall on a response
from userspace, but yes we will have the same issue of dealing with buggy
userspace. At least for PCI, I think there is provision to use surprise removal
facility, where guest can be notified of malfunctioning device. In case of
userspace (vduse daemon) not responding in time, can the surprise removal event
be injected by VMM (hypervisor in our case)? Guest can decide what to do with it
next.

Yes for the same reason of faster access, we wish to have config information
cached in hypervisor. In case of VDUSE,

Guest read -> (VM exit) -> VHOST_VDPA_GET_CONFIG -> vduse_vdpa_get_config

Basically a guest read terminates in host kernel, before resuming.

In our case,

Guest read - (VM exit) - Hyp emulates read - (VM resume)

So a guest read would terminate in hypervisor itself, before it is resumed. 

Without this optimization, guest VCPU would have stalled until VMM in host can
emulate it, which can be long, especially a concern when the read is issued in
hot path (interrupt handler, w/o MSI_X).

Any additional pointers you can share? I will go over them and revert.

I didn't think vdpa-gunyah would need to provide any UAPI. VDUSE daemon
functionality would be inside VMM itself. For example, the virtio-block backend
in VMM would create a VDUSE device and pass on key configuration information to
VDUSE kernel module. The vdpa device created subsequently (vdpa dev add ..) 
will be bound to vdpa-gunyah driver, which pulls the configuration information
and passes on to hypervisor, which will emulate all further access from VM. 

> Wonder any reason why vhost-vDPA can be used here.

I think vhost-vDPA will imply that VMM still tracks the device on its PCI/MMIO
transports and will be involved for any register read from VM? We didn't want
VMM to be involved in emulating register access of VM. Instead hyp will emulate
most of those accesses.  I need to think more, but I am thinking the VMM will
not even track this device on its PCI/MMIO transports, but rather on a
different, vdpa?, transport.

Ok thanks for your feedback!
