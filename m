I have a question about your description.
In I/O controlling, how do you think about the meaning of "fair" among cgro=
ups ?
These days I was confused about it.
IMHO, if they have a same access time and same access opportunity for
disk I/O regardless of their I/O style(sequential / random / mixed /
=85), I think it is fare.
Of course, in this fair situation, the cgroups with same priority or
weight can have a different I/O bandwidth. but, I think it will be in
reasonable range.
So, if other cgroups with fast I/O was sacrificed for the cgroup with
too late I/O to equaliz the I/O quantity, it can be considered
"unfair" for the cgroup with fast I/O
Do I have something wrong about the "fair" concept?
This is just my opinion :)
I welcome and appreciate for other opinions and comments about this

PS)
Andrea, this question is not related to the io-controller
But, I just wonder your another project, network io-throttle, is going
on now? My colleague has researched the similar project and he is try
to implement another one. And i am also interested in net
io-controller. Thank you
