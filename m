This should no longer be an issue, as arm64 uses CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ
and the number of interrupts is not limited in any form.

My point was more that the device driver should not need to care about
the interrupt number: it gets made up on the spot when the MSI is
needed, and then it is only used to request the IRQ. This can be
simplified into one interface at the device driver level, even though
the internal still use numbers somewhere. If we ever remove IRQ numbers
from the driver API, this part doesn't need to get touched again.
