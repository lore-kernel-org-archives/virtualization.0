As long as they can provide the same guarantee that the DMA ops are
completely equivalent between virtio and other PCI devices, at least on
the same bus, ie, we don't have to go hack special DMA ops.

I think the latter is really what Christoph wants to avoid for good
reasons.

Not fan of that either...
