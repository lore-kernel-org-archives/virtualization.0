Yes but the handler would always have to be registered, right?

Yes. Basically depending on an internal device state, disabling MSI
sometimes wedges it.  The most easy to debug effect is if it starts
sending INTx interrupts, for which there's no handler currently.
Full system reset always gets us out of the bad state.

It's case 2. Except it doesn't actually set the pending
bit, because PCI spec has language like

	"While a vector is masked, the function is prohibited from sending the
	associated message, and the function must set the associated Pending bit"

but doesn't actually require to set pending if bus master enable
prevents sending MSI.
