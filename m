Thanks, Jean. Yeah, my understanding is that old revisions of VT-d looks
more like the ARM SMMUv3. But with scalable mode introduced, there's no
need for a pvIOMMU to allocate a guest version PASID table on VT-d.

So my question becomes: why do we need a library that manages PASID
tables in the guest? To also support AMD IOMMU besides ARM SMMUv3(
I saw your spec proposed both ATTACH_TABLE request for AMD GCR3 table
and ATTACH_TABLE request for AMD page table, but don't know which one
is more preferred in practice)?
