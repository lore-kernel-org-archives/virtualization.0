You mean "System RAM (driver managed)" in /proc/iomem? See below for more=
.

So, I think I have to clarify something here. We do have two ways to kexe=
c

1. kexec_load(): User space (kexec-tools) crafts the memmap (e.g., using
/sys/firmware/memmap on x86-64) and selects memory where to place the
kexec images (e.g., using /proc/iomem)

2. kexec_file_load(): The kernel reuses the (basically) raw firmware
memmap and selects memory where to place kexec images.

We are talking about changing 1, to behave like 2 in regards to
dax/kmem. 2. does currently not add any hotplugged memory to the
fixed-up e820, and it should be fixed regarding hotplugged DIMMs that
would appear in e820 after a reboot.

Now, all these policy discussions are nice and fun, but I don't really
see a good reason to (ab)use /sys/firmware/memmap for that (e.g., parent
properties). If you want to be able to make this configurable, then
e.g., add a way to configure this in the kernel (for example along with
kmem) to make 1. and 2. behave the same way. Otherwise, you really only
can change 1.


Now, let's clarify what I want regarding virtio-mem:

1. kexec should not add virtio-mem memory to the initial firmware
   memmap. The driver has to be in charge as discussed.
2. kexec should not place kexec images onto virtio-mem memory. That
   would end badly.
3. kexec should still dump virtio-mem memory via kdump.

This has to work when using kexec_load() or kexec_file_load(). This has
to theoretically work on different architectures (especially, without
/sys/firmware/memmap). kexec-tools has to have access to that
information to figure out what to do.

Regarding 1:
- kexec_file_load(): works out of the box currently.
- kexec_load(): Don't create entries in /sys/firmware/memmap (for
  reasons discussed)
Regarding 2:
- kexec_file_load(): tag the resources as IORESOURCE_MEM_DRIVER_MANAGED
  (inspired by Eric)
- kexec_load(): indicate the memory as "System RAM (driver managed)"
Regarding 3:
- Same as 2. kexec-tools need to be thought to properly consider the
  memory during kdump.

Now, you are asking, "why System RAM (driver managed)". I don't think
it's strictly needed right now, but it feels cleaner. E.g., for
virtio-mem the current plan is to have /proc/iomem look like

           :/# cat /proc/iomem
            [...]
            140000000-333ffffff : virtio-mem (virtio0)
              140000000-147ffffff : System RAM (driver managed)
              148000000-14fffffff : System RAM (driver managed)
              150000000-157ffffff : System RAM (driver managed)

One could judge by looking at the hierarchy, that this memory is
special. kexec-tools will skip it currently in either form.

If we all agree here, that we can drop it, then let's drop it,
especially if it would allow dax/kmem to use the same mechanism I am
proposing here for virtio-mem.


Now, it would be fairly simple to add a config option for dax/kmem,
making it configurable in the kernel, whether to add memory via
MHP_DRIVER_MANAGED or just as we do now. It would contradict with the
"raw firmware/prov..." description of /sys/firmware/memmap, but hey,
somebody explicitly configured it, so it can't be wrong.
