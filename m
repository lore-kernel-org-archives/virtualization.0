Not at all. You are free to patch your kernel if you want.

It helps you workload, and breaks all others.

If compaction is never triggered, we'll never be able to get high order

That discussion does not belong to this thread, again.

Seriously... I think you missed whole point of having frag allocation on
pages, not kmem_cache.
