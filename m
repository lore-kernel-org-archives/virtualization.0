Sometimes it is essential for libvirt to be able to configure MTU
on guest's NICs to a value different from 1500.

The change adds a new field to configuration area of network
devices. It will be used to pass initial MTU from the device to
the driver, and to pass modified MTU from driver to the device
when a new MTU is assigned by the guest OS.

In addition, in order to support backward and forward
compatibility, we introduce a new feature bit called
VIRTIO_NET_F_DEFAULT_MTU.

Added conformance statements for a device and a driver.
