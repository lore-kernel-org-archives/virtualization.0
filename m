Because we do the buffering at higher level scheduler and mostly release
the buffered bios in the FIFO order, it might break the underlying IO
schedulers. Generally it is the decision of IO scheduler to determine in
what order to release buffered bios.

For example, If there is one task of io priority 0 in a cgroup and rest of
the tasks are of io prio 7. All the tasks belong to best effort class. If
tasks of lower priority (7) do lot of IO, then due to buffering there is
a chance that IO from lower prio tasks is seen by CFQ first and io from
higher prio task is not seen by cfq for quite some time hence that task
not getting it fair share with in the cgroup. Similiar situations can
arise with RT tasks also.

What do you mean by that IO issued to underlying device does not go
through IO scheduler? loop device will be associated with a file and
IO will ultimately go to the IO scheduler which is serving those file
blocks?

What's the use case scenario of doing IO control at loop device?
Ultimately the resource contention will take place on actual underlying
physical device where the file blocks are. Will doing the resource control
there not solve the issue for you?

Thanks
