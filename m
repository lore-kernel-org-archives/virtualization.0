I did not say that device_register would return the probe_error. On the 
contrary, the code I added explicitly ensures that proper cleanup is done
for  the failure of  device_register and if the  probe function were
called on the same context executing the device_register call,
 the failure of the probe call as well (looking at the stack trace while in
the probe function, this appeared to be the case currently).

If you look at the existing code; the current  code did not deal with the failure of
device_register() - it over-writes the return value of device_register with
that of the probe error. This patch fixed that problem.

The current code dealt with the probe error by spinning up a work item to
deal with the probe failure. This work item would try to unregister the device 
that was not fully registered and this caused a problem. I tried to fix this
problem by getting rid of the work item and dealing with the probe 
failure cleanup in the same context as the call to device_register.
Since no other driver deals with probe failures this way, I will get rid 
of this code in the next version of this patch.
