The first use case is high performance small block random IO access into
KVM guest from IBLOCK/FILEIO + pSCSI passthrough backends.  (see below)

The second use case is shared storage access across multiple KVM guests
using TCM level SPC-3 persistent reservations + ALUA multipath logic.

The third use case is future DIF support within virtio-scsi supported
guests that we connect directly to tcm_vhost.

To give an idea of how things are looking on the performance side, here
some initial numbers for small block (4k) mixed random IOPs using the
following fio test setup:

[randrw]
rw=randrw
rwmixwrite=25
rwmixread=75
size=131072m
ioengine=libaio
direct=1
iodepth=64
blocksize=4k
filename=/dev/sdb

The backend is a single iomemory_vsl (FusionIO) raw flash block_device
using IBLOCK w/ emulate_write_cache=1 set.  Also note the noop scheduler
has been set with virtio-scsi LUNs.  Here are the QEMU cli opts for both
cases:

./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -smp 2 -m 2048 -serial
file:/tmp/vhost-serial.txt -hda debian_squeeze_amd64_standard-old.qcow2
-vhost-scsi id=vhost-scsi0,wwpn=naa.600140579ad21088,tpgt=1 -device
virtio-scsi-pci,vhost-scsi=vhost-scsi0,event_idx=off

./x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -smp 4 -m 2048 -serial
file:/tmp/vhost-serial.txt -hda debian_squeeze_amd64_standard-old.qcow2
-drive file=/dev/fioa,format=raw,if=none,id=sdb,cache=none,aio=native
-device virtio-scsi-pci,id=mcbus -device scsi-disk,drive=sdb


fio randrw workload | virtio-scsi-raw | virtio-scsi+tcm_vhost | bare-metal raw block
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25 Write / 75 Read  |      ~15K       |         ~45K          |         ~70K
75 Write / 25 Read  |      ~20K       |         ~55K          |         ~60K


In the first case, virtio-scsi+tcm_vhost is out performing by 3x
compared to virtio-scsi-raw using QEMU SCSI emulation with the same raw
flash backend device.  For the second case heavier WRITE case, tcm_vhost
is nearing full bare-metal utilization (~55K vs. ~60K).

Also converting tcm_vhost to use proper cmwq process context I/O
submission will help to get even closer to bare metal speeds for both
work-loads.

Yes, QEMU needs a sane level of host OS independent functional SCSI
emulation, I don't think that is the interesting point up for debate
here..  ;)

I think performance wise it's now pretty clear that vhost is
outperforming QEMU block with virtio-scsi for intestive small block
randrw workloads.  When connected to raw block flash backends where we
avoid the SCSI LLD bottleneck for small block random I/O on the KVM host
all-together, the difference between the two case is even larger based
upon these initial benchmarks.

Thanks for your comments!
