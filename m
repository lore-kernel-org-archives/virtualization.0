Hi Fernando,

Had a question.

IIUC, at the time of submtting the bio, io_context will be known only for =

synchronous request. For asynchronous request it will not be known
(ex. writing the dirty pages back to disk) and one shall have to take
the longer path (bio-cgroup thing) to ascertain the io_context associated
with a request.

If that's the case, than it looks like we shall have to always traverse the
longer path in case of asynchronous IO. By putting the io_context pointer
in bio, we will just shift the time of pointer traversal. (From CFQ to high=
er
layers).

So probably it is not worth while to put io_context pointer in bio? Am I
missing something?

Thanks
Vivek
