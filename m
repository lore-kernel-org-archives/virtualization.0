That's too complex I think. Let's convert to bool, like this:

/* Make sure we don't change IFF_MULTI_QUEUE flag */
if (!!(ifr->ifr_flags & IFF_MULTI_QUEUE) != !!(tun->flags & TUN_TAP_MQ))
                       return -EINVAL;


You'll want to mention it's a stable candidate when you post this
but I think you are not supposed to copy stable - davem does this himself.
