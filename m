How are you getting 1:1 to work?  Is it something that L0 QEMU can
advertise to L1?  If so, can we just do that unconditionally, which
would make my patch work?

I have no objection to 1:1 devices in general.  It's only devices that
the PCI code on the guest identifies as not 1:1 but that are
nonetheless 1:1 that cause problems.
