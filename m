Of these numbers, I think it's important to highlight that the 2 thread 
case is 33% faster and the 2 -> 4 thread case scales linearly (100%) 
while the pre-patch case sees negative scaling going from 2 -> 4 threads 
(-39%).

I haven't run your patches yet, but from looking at the code, it looks 
good. It's pretty straightforward. See feel free to add my reviewed-by.

Rusty, do you want to ack this (and I'll slurp it up for 3.17) or take 
this yourself? Or something else?
