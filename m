I guess you are saying we never need to signal host/device
that we are out of memory, it's enough that packets are dropped?
It seemed like a useful thing for hypervisor to know about on general
principles, even though I don't think kvm uses this info at this point.

Exactly, this is what I tried to describe in the part that
you have snipped out - but this means queue is always full.

Also, I wonder whether allocating before passing
frame to the stack might slow us down a tiny bit e.g. if an application
is polling this socket on another CPU.

Maybe a slightly better strategy is to do the above when queue depth
is running low. E.g. when queue is 3/4 empty, try
allocating before giving frames to net core,
and recycle buffers on error.

Not sure how much of a win this is.
