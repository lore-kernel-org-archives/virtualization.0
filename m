If QEMU wants to fix this, it looks like it wouldn't be so bad.  The
virtio code could keep track of the address space in use.  It looks
like a lot of the changes would be simplifications, but vring_map
would have to go away.  That would cause some performance hit due to
the loss of the permanent ring mapping, bit it would be no worse than
the temporary mappings that already exist for indirect descriptors and
actual data.
