Lazy - mea culpa, though I'm using mutt so it isn't even hard.

The question still stands: the test results are only valid
if CPU was at 100% in all configurations.
This is the reason I generally prefer it when people report
throughput divided by CPU (power would be good too but it still
isn't easy for people to get that number).
