Right, that's what I meant with my sentence above. I'm not sure
if we need to differentiate traditional macvlan and VEPA though.
AFAICT, the only difference should be the handling of broadcast
and multicast frames returning from the hairpin turn. Since this
does not happen with a traditional macvlan, we can always send them
to all macvlan ports except the source port.

The patch from Eric Biederman to allow macvlan to bridge between
its slave ports is at

http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-netdev/2009/3/9/5125774

I could not find any patches for the other features (or bugs).

Right, I understand.

I don't object to having VEPA supported in the bridge code at all.
I think your patch is simple enough so it won't hurt in the bridge
code. If Stephen prefers to do VEPA only in one component, we should
probably make it possible for that component to act as a bridge between
1+n existing interfaces as well. You can almost do that with the regular
macvlan and the bridge driver, like

      / macvlan0 - br0 - tap0
eth0 -- macvlan1 - br1 - tap1
      \ macvlan2 - br2 - tap2

Here, you can have two guests attached to tap devices (or xen net ...)
and the macvlan driver doing the VEPA. Of course this is not how bridge
works -- you would have the same mac addresses on two sides of
the bridge.

So we could have another macvlan backend (let's call it macvbridge)
so you can do this:

      / macvlan0 - 'qemu -net raw'
eth0 -- macvtap0 - 'qemu -net tap,fd=3 3<>/dev/net/macvtap0'
      \ macvbr0 -- tap0 - 'qemu -net tap'

The macvbr driver could this way be used to associate an existing
network device to a slave of a macvlan port. Not sure if this
has any significant advantage over your bridge patches, it does
have the obvious disadvantage that someone needs to implement
it first, while your patch is there ;-)
