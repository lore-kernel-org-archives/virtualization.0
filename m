The guests were broken before qemu implemented this.

virtio-net had checksum offload long before it was ever implemented in 
qemu.  Not even lguest implemented it because the interfaces weren't 
available in tun/tap.  I'm not sure how Rusty ever tested it.  We only 
discovered this bug after checksum offload was implemented in tun/tap 
and we were able to enable it in QEMU.  At that point, the guests had 
shipped and were in the wild.

The real problem was that we implemented a feature in a guest driver 
without having a backend implementation and then shipped the code.  
Shipping untested code is a recipe for failure.

If we had implemented the front-end feature only when a backend 
implementation was available, we would have caught this, fixed it in the 
guests, and not be in the situation because there wouldn't be these 
broken guests.

Which guests?  Newer versions of dhclient should work as expected.

I mean from a UI perspective.  IOW, if users have to explicitly choose 
to use vhost-net, then it's okay to force them to use newer guests that 
support vhost-net.  However, if we make it transparent, then it has to 
support everything that QEMU virtio has ever supported which is 
problematic for exactly the reasons you are now encountering.

Shouldn't we apply the same argument to the Windows RTC implementation 
and say that Windows should not rely on counting interrupts?  Or that it 
shouldn't spin in a tight loop checking interrupt status with interrupts 
disabled after receiving an interrupt?

Supporting broken guests is a big part of what we do in QEMU.  We do 
what we need to do to make guests that we cannot change work.  When this 
first was implemented, there were a good number of pre-existing guests 
that broke because we enabled checksum offload.

If we can fix the guests to avoid doing ugly things in QEMU, we should, 
but we can't regress an otherwise working guest just because we think 
the solution is ugly in QEMU.
