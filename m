Hi Linus,

We  took your original suggestion - pass in pre-allocated buffers to load the addresses (now we use a list of pre-allocated page blocks as buffers). Hope that suggestion is still acceptable (the advantage of this method was explained here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/6/28/184).
Look forward to getting your feedback. Thanks.

Best,
Wei
