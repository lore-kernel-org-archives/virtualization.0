I'm not following your reasoning here. In the cover letter, you say that
VMware reviewed your work. If VMware wants to provide P2P support to its
users, it can add the necessary support itself. As for Microsoft, there's
no need to worry; it can handle the ACPI changes just fine.

Of course not. P2P operation depends on the hypervisor topology, which the
proposed code does not account for.

The kernel community has no obligation to accommodate users of proprietary
products who are unwilling to invest in a proper solution.

Please keep these hacks out of tree.

Thanks
