Applied, thanks Michael.

I am really trying to be patient, but we are about to run out of
time for fixing the adjust header XDP stuff.

That should have been resolved in a week or two, but now we're
basically a month or so later.

Please come to some kind of agreement about how to implement this
because we can't let v4.10 go out without this being resolved.

Thank you.
