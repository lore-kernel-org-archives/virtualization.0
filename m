Rick mentioned in another email that I messed up my test parameters a bit,
so I will re-run the tests, incorporating his suggestions.

What I was attempting to measure was the effect of an unpaced UDP_STREAM
on the latency of more moderated traffic. Because I am interested in
what effect an abusive guest has on other guests and how that my be
mitigated.

Could you suggest some tests that you feel are more appropriate?
