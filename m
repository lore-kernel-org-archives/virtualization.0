xen: use iret directly where possible

Most of the time we can simply use the iret instruction to exit the
kernel, rather than having to use the iret hypercall - the only
exception is if we're returning into vm86 mode, or from delivering an
NMI (which we don't support yet).

When running native, iret has the behaviour of testing for a pending
interrupt atomically with re-enabling interrupts.  Unfortunately
there's no way to do this with Xen, so there's a window in which we
could get a recursive exception after enabling events but before
actually returning to userspace.

This causes three problems:

 - If the interrupt causes a softirq to be queued, we will return to
   userspace without processing it, since its already after the point at
   which we look for queued softirqs.  This means it could be an
   unbounded amount of time before it gets processed on next kernel
   entry.

 - If the interrupt causes a signal to be delivered to the current process,
   the signal will be marked pending on the process, but it will not
   get delivered because we're past the point where pending signals
   are detected.  Again, it could be an unbounded amount of time
   before the signal gets delivered.

 - The recursion is, in theory, unbounded.  There's a small chance that
   a series of unfortunate events will cause the exception frames to
   build up and overrun the stack.  But that's very unlikely.

To deal with this, the xen event upcall handler checks to see if the
EIP is within the critical section of the iret code, after events
are (potentially) enabled up to the iret itself.  If its within this
range, it calls the iret critical section fixup, which adjusts the
stack to deal with any unrestored registers, and then shifts the
stack frame up to replace the previous invocation.
