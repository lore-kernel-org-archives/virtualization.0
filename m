That was just an example.

As you can tell, I'm trying to say that is wrong :)

the hv_util.c driver should have a pointer in each of the driver_info
that describes what it is, and then in the probe function, you use that
to hook up the correct things needed.

None of this hard-coded mess like you currently have.

Trust me, you want that pointer, put it in, and if you never use it,
I'll buy you a beer.  But if I send you a patch using it, well...

Ah, nevermind, that is something that busses add in their core if they
want it.  I added it for PCI and USB, maybe I should move that to the
driver core so that others can get it automatically one of these days...
