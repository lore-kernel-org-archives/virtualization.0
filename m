Couple of comments on this.
First, there is only single virtio device initialized at probe time,
how this will work on the host system with multiple guests? Is it
possible to have multiple virtual devices?
Second, each virtual device has an array of names, and each socket can
be bound to one of them, but it is not allowed to have multiple sockets
bound to the same name, so it looks like there is no possibility to have
several sockets communicating via signel channel, was this intentional?
And third, tasklet callbacks do not use bh socket locking, and while it
is not something bad, but rt folks want (dream) to replace it with
process context, so this at least requires some note in comments.

Except that about questions, this patch looks good.
