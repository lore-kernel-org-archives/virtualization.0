It should be there just for 1 release cycle. I have broken out the btrfs 
patch to the btrfs list and I didn't make the kzfree to kfree_sensitive 
conversion there as that patch was in front in my patch list. So 
depending on which one lands first, there can be a window where the 
compilation may fail without this workaround. I am going to send out 
another patch in the next release cycle to remove it.

Cheers,
