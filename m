Sorry for replying to this ancient thread. There was some remaining
issue that I don't think the initial net_failover patch got addressed
cleanly, see:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1815268

The renaming of 'eth0' to 'ens4' fails because the udev userspace was
not specifically writtten for such kernel automatic enslavement.
Specifically, if it is a bond or team, the slave would typically get
renamed *before* virtual device gets created, that's what udev can
control (without getting netdev opened early by the other part of
kernel) and other userspace components for e.g. initramfs,
init-scripts can coordinate well in between. The in-kernel
auto-enslavement of net_failover breaks this userspace convention,
which don't provides a solution if user care about consistent naming
on the slave netdevs specifically.

Previously this issue had been specifically called out when IFF_HIDDEN
and the 1-netdev was proposed, but no one gives out a solution to this
problem ever since. Please share your mind how to proceed and solve
this userspace issue if netdev does not welcome a 1-netdev model.

See above for clarifications.
