Thanks, I missed the word "could".

Should be easy to test, but the question is, how hard should we fight to
maintain ordering?  Dave?

It comes down to this.  We can say in the spec that a virtio nic which
offers VIRTIO_F_NET_RFS:

1) Must do a perfect matching, with perfect ordering.  This means you need
   perfect filters, and handle inter-queue ordering if you change a
   filter (requeue packets?)
2) Must do a perfect matching, but don't worry about ordering across changes.
3) Best effort matching, with perfect ordering.
3) Best effort matching, best effort ordering.

For a perfect filtering setup, the virtio nic needs to either say how
many filter slots it has, or have a way to fail an RFS request.  For
best effort, you can simply ignore RFS requests or accept hash
collisions, without bothering the guest driver at all.

Thanks,
Rusty.
