The layout is always virtio header followed by device specific header.
We started with a small header so when more data was added, we could not
extend the header unconditionally.

We can't change that behaviour for MSI-X now, guests and
hosts rely on it.

That's because of backwards compatibility with old guests.
When we know the guest is new, we expose new layout,
but old guests must see old layout.

Yes it can, e.g. at guest reset. Generally features can be tweaked
any way guest likes until status is set to OK.

Not sure what you mean by 'run time'. Guest can reset
or disable the device, change any parameters,
then re-enable.

There are any number of ways to lay out the structure.  I went for what
seemed a simplest one.  For MSI-X the train has left the station.  We
can probably still tweak where the high 32 bit features
for 64 bit features are.  No idea if it's worth it.
