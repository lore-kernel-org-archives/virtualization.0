If the virtual key slots in the uapi are per file descriptor rather than
per inode, then other programs cannot interfere with each other's
virtual key slots. Each program gets its own virtual key space when it
opens a file descriptor. Sharing is only possible by inheriting or
passing a file descriptor to another process and that's good for
security.
