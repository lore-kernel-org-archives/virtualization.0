The result is, I see about 5%-10% improvement for per cpu throughput on
guest tx. But about 5% degradation on per cpu transaction rate on TCP_RR.

5%-10% improvement on for per cpu throughput on guest rx, but some
regressions (5%) on guest tx. So we'd better keep and make it doing
properly.

Will post V2 for your reviewing.
