Series makes no sense to me, sorry.  I dislike the 2nd patch, I see no
reason why we need to make changes all over the place for this...?

Also, if we go with 2nd patch, why do we still need the first?

"Don't do that, then"?

I think the kernel should not crash when misused, but I don't think
kernel should have to do extreme stunts to detect such loops.

There are probably many other ways to make kernel allocate lots of
memory or waste cpu cycles.

E.g. via create use of veth and bridges, sched plug, teql, ...

Its small enough, so I have no objections to this patch.

I think it would be better to first go to the drawing board and make ONE
facility that governs the recursion part.

From a quick glance, the difference is historical from time when
per-module pcpu counters were used, so nf_dup netdev could not see the state
of nft_dup toggle.  Now that its in task struct anyway, maybe its time to
just zap the egress recursion counter and first make a patch that
uses the bool toggle for both egress and normal dup?

I would like to remove code, not add more.

Thats unrelated problem.  There are other places that do TTL/HL
decrements.  I think it makes sense to clean this up in -next and
add common helpers and then use those.
