We can simply document this, as I suggested already ("either the old
page, or a page filled with zero"). Perfectly fine IMHO.

Informing makes sense, yes. And we inform it via the poison feature, if
possible. This discussion is about "what happens if the poison feature
is not there, but we do have want_init_on_free()."

If the hypervisor can no longer guarantee "either the old page, or a
page filled with zero", it would have to disable the feature. I don't
see that happening, really.

I don't have a too strong opinion here, but this sounds like one of the
improvements we wanted to have for free page hinting, but learned that
it's not possible because it was *underspecified*.
