Agreed, but we'll definitely address all the style issues in our subsequent patch posts. Actually Shreyas showed me his raw patch and it had tabs and not spaces, so we're trying to figure out if either Outlook (corporate blessed) or our Exchange server is converting those tabs to spaces or something.

Absolutely: 4/4 was simply a prototype to see if it helps with performance any with certain benchmarks. So far it looks like there's a small performance gain with microbenchmarks like netperf, but we're hoping having multiple queues with multiple vectors might have some promise with macro benchmarks like SPECjbb. If it pans out, we'll most likely make it a module_param with some reasonable defaults, possibly just 1/1 by default.

Cool. Will do.

UPT stands for Uniform Pass Thru, a spec/framework VMware developed with its IHV partners to implement the fast path (Tx/Rx) features of vmxnet3 in silicon. Some of these #defines that appear not to be used are based on this initial spec that VMware shared with its IHV partners.

We divided the emulated vmxnet3 PCIe device's registers into two sets on two separate BARs: BAR 0 for the UPT registers we asked IHV partners to implement that we emulate in our hypervisor if no physical device compliant with the UPT spec is available to pass thru from a virtual machine, and BAR 1 for registers we always emulate for slow path/control operations like setting the MAC address, or activating/quiescing/resetting the device, etc.

Great. In that case we'll stay with not allocating a separate vector for events for now.

Thanks!
