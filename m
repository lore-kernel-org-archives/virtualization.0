blk-mq does not attempt to freeze/sync existing work if a CPU goes away,
and we reconfigure the mappings. So I don't think the above is unexpected,
if you are doing CPU hot unplug while running a fio job.

While it's a bit annoying that we trigger the WARN_ON() for a condition
that can happen, we're basically interested in it if it triggers for
normal operations.
