I think that's the part we need to improve for the existing 
implementation when going with the above direction.

As also stated in the commit log, the lock was proposed to synchronize 
accesses to elements
of struct virtio_balloon and its queue operation. To be more precise, 
fill_balloon/leak_balloon/migrationpage
share vb->pfns[] and vb->num_pfns, which can actually be changed to use 
local variables of their own each.

For example, for migratepage:
+       __virtio32 pfn;
...
-       vb->num_pfns = VIRTIO_BALLOON_PAGES_PER_PAGE;
-       set_page_pfns(vb, vb->pfns, newpage);
-       tell_host(vb, vb->inflate_vq);
+       set_page_pfns(vb, &pfn, newpage);
+       tell_host(vb, vb->inflate_vq, &pfn, VIRTIO_BALLOON_PAGES_PER_PAGE);

For the queue access, it could be a small lock for each queue access, 
which I think won't cause the issue.

Without the lock being held, why couldn't we use __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM at 
xb_set_page()?
