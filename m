But would this happen while a system is running live?

I agree that in general, SCSI targets don't need this, but I'm pretty sure that 
if a guest probes for a command, you migrate to an old version, and that command 
is no longer there, badness will ensue.

It's different when you're talking about a reboot happening or a 
disconnect/reconnect due to firmware upgrade.  The OS would naturally be 
reprobing in this case.
