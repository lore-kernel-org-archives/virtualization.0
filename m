That's a temporary limitation.

Or maybe because guest is expected to use more memory.

All this in place of a simple retry loop within guest?

People working on memory hotplug can't be expected to worry about
balloon. And maintainers have other things to do than debug hard to
trigger failure reports from the field.

The usefulness of the whole patchset hasn't been proven in the field yet.
The more uncovered corner cases there are, the higher the chance that
it will turn out not to be useful after all.
