Basically yes, we could start dropping packets immediately
once GFP_ATOMIC allocations fail and repost the buffer to host,
and hope memory is available by the time we get the next interrupt.
But we wanted host to have visibility into the fact that
we are out of memory and packets are dropped, so we did not want to
repost.
If we don't repost how do we know memory is finally available?
We went for a timer based workqueue thing.
What do you suggest?
