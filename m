Except for x86 :(  That's presumably fixable, though.

My thought (which I completely failed to articulate) was to have a
spec for a virtio device that exposes a complete virtio bus along with
hotplug and per-cpu interrupts (a la MSI-X).  This might be a bit
complicated, but it would work everywhere without any firmware or
platform issues.
