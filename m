Further, it looks like when the limits are not bypassed, they
easily result in deadlocks. For example, with
multiple tun devices attached to a single bridge in host,
if a number of these have their queues blocked,
others will reach the socket buffer limit and
traffic on the bridge will get blocked altogether.

It might be better to drop the limits altogether
unless we can fix them. Happily, as the limits are off by
default, doing so does not require kernel changes.

tracking data ownership might benefit others such as various zero-copy
strategies. It might need to be done per-page, though, not per-skb.
