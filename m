Well, take the slightly more elaborate example or a raid[56] setup. This
will need to sometimes issue multiple leaf level ios to satisfy one top
level io.

How are you going to attribute this fairly?

I don't think the issue of bandwidth availability like above will really
be an issue, if your stripe is set up symmetrically, the contention
should average out to both (all) disks in equal measures.

The only real issue I can see is with linear volumes, but those are
stupid anyway - non of the gains but all the risks.
