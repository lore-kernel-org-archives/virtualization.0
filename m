You have a point.
Current 2/4 patch is lack of calling migrate/isolate.
It is not complete without 3/4.

I'll add calling migrate/isolate() at next spin.

I like "mobile".
"movable" is for pages allocated with GFP_MOVABLE.
I think "movable" is a little ambiguous in this situation.

I think compaction.c is suitable.
