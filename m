I also realize that some kernel threads such as pdflush perform actual
writes instead of tasks which originally issued write requests.
So, taka is developing a blocking I/O tacking down mechanism which is
based on cgroup memory controller and posted it to LKML:
http://lwn.net/Articles/273802/

However, the current implementation works well with Xen virtual
machines, because virtual machine's I/Os are issued from its own kernel
thread and can be tracked down. Please see a benchmark result of Xen
virtual machine:
http://people.valinux.co.jp/~ryov/dm-ioband/benchmark/xen-blktap.html

As for KVM, dm-ioband was also able to track down block I/Os as I
expected. When dm-ioband is used in virtual machine environment,
I think even the current implementation will work fairly.

But unfortunately I found KVM still had a performance problem that
it couldn't handle I/Os efficiently yet, which should be improved.
I already posted this problem to kvm-devel list:

Thank you for your advice. I'll have these fixes included in the next
release.
