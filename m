Uh indeed. And yet I could swear I've written that code... somewhere. I
will add it to the batch of v0.5 changes, it shouldn't be too invasive.

Yes, keeping VIRTIO_IOMMU_PROBE_PROPERTY_TYPE_MASK is probably best
(though it is a mouthful).

For SW_MSI, certainly. The driver allocates a fixed IOVA region for
mapping the MSI doorbell. But the driver has to know whether the doorbell
region is translated or bypassed.

The MSI region is architectural on x86 IOMMUs, but
implementation-defined on virtio-iommu. It depends which platform the host
is emulating. In Linux, x86 IOMMU drivers register the bypass region
because there always is an IOAPIC on the other end, with a fixed MSI
address. But virtio-iommu may be either behind a GIC, an APIC or some
other IRQ chip.

The driver *could* go over all the irqchips/platforms it knows and try to
guess if there is a fixed doorbell or if it needs to reserve an IOVA for
them, but it would look horrible. I much prefer having a well-defined way
of doing this, so a description from the device.

Yes, all regions reported in sysfs reserved_regions in the host would be
reported as RESV_T_RESERVED by virtio-iommu.

Agreed. I will add something about RESV_T_RESERVED with the PCI bridge
example in Implementation Notes. Do you think the MSI examples at the end
need improvement as well? I can try to explain that RESV_MSI regions in
virtio-iommu are only those of the emulated platform, not the HW or SW MSI
regions from the host.

Thanks,
Jean
