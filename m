Okay, I was using a wrong mental model of how this works.  B must be
aware of the translation from A's address space into B.  Both qemu and
the kernel can do this on their own, but if B is another guest, then it
cannot do this except by calling H.

vhost-copy cannot work fully transparently, because you need some memory
to copy into.  Maybe we can have a pci device with a large BAR that
contains buffers for copying, and also a translation from A addresses
into B addresses.  It would work something like this:

  A prepares a request with both out and in buffers
  vhost-copy allocates memory in B's virtio-copy BAR, copies (using a
DMA engine) the out buffers into it, and rewrites the out descriptors to
contain B addresses
  B services the request, and updates the in addresses in the
descriptors to point at B memory
  vhost-copy copies (using a DMA engine) the in buffers into A memory

Those rules of thumb always have exceptions, I'd say it's the default
that the guest can override.
