It's inability to handle sequences like the above sounds to me like
a very good argument to _not_ merge the unwinder back into the tree.

To me, that unwinder is nothing but trouble, it severly limits what
cases you can use special calling conventions via inline asm (and we
have done that on several occaisions) and even ignoring that the
unwinder only works half the time.

Please don't subject us to another couple months of hair-pulling only
to have Linus yank the thing out again, there are certainly more
useful things to spend time on :-)
