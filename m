It doesn't really add a new try, the old code is:


-	for (;;) {
-		new = _Q_LOCKED_VAL;
-		if (val)
-			new = tail | (val & _Q_LOCKED_PENDING_MASK);
-
-		old = atomic_cmpxchg(&lock->val, val, new);
-		if (old == val)
-			break;
-
-		val = old;
-	}

  	/*
-	 * we won the trylock; forget about queueing.
  	 */
-	if (new == _Q_LOCKED_VAL)
-		goto release;

The trylock happens if the "if (val)" hits the else branch.

What the patch does is change it from attempting two transition with a 
single cmpxchg:

-	 * 0,0,0 -> 0,0,1 ; trylock
-	 * p,y,x -> n,y,x ; prev = xchg(lock, node)

to first doing the trylock, then the xchg.  If the trylock passes and 
the xchg returns prev=0,0,0, the next step of the algorithm goes to the 
locked/uncontended state

+	/*
+	 * claim the lock:
+	 *
+	 * n,0 -> 0,1 : lock, uncontended

Similar to your suggestion of patch 3, it's expected that the xchg will 
*not* return prev=0,0,0 after a failed trylock.

However, I *do* agree with you that it's simpler to just squash this 
patch into 01/11.
