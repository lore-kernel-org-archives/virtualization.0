Then fix the BIOS :)

Seriously, that is what the PCI hotplug spec says to do, right?

But they did not implement this for Vista, and pulled it before it
shipped, right?  That is what the driver development documentation for
Vista said that I read.

Do you know if they are going to add it back for Windows 7?  If so, then
we should probably look into this, otherwise, no need to, as the BIOSes
will be fixed properly.

Yes, push the burden of getting this right onto the OS developers,
instead of doing it properly in the BIOS, how fun :(

Seriously, it isn't that hard to reserve enough space on most machines
in the BIOS to get this correct.  It only gets messy when you have
hundreds of hotplug PCI slots and bridges.  Even then, the BIOS writers
have been able to resolve this for a while due to this kind of hardware
shipping successfully with Linux for many years now.

It is being blocked because you are sending out html email.

Please reconfigure your gmail client to not do that, and your mail will
go through just fine.
