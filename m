Then we are back to virtio driver telling DMA core
whether it wants a 1:1 mapping in the iommu?
If that's acceptable to others, I don't think that's too bad.

But not virtio-pci I think - that's broken for that usecase since we use
weaker barriers than required for real IO, as these have measureable
overhead.  We could have a feature "is a real PCI device",
that's completely reasonable.
