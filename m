There is at least one monitoring tool - collectl - which gets a trifle 
upset when the actual speed through an interface is significantly 
greater than the reported link speed.  I have to wonder how unique it is 
in that regard.

Doesn't mean there can't be a default, but does suggest it should be 
rather high.
