I think it might be late for 3.7 already, I'd prefer to let this bake
for a while, ensure it passes my test suites, at the least.  But I'll
let Rusty take the final call.

OK.

OK, I see.  The BUG_ON would guarantee at run-time, but the
compile-time advantage wasn't obvious.

Yes, it's much easier if we don't have special cases in these generic
routines.

Can you please split that into a separate patch?
