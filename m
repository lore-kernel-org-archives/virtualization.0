[I.L] In the current proposal descriptor size == SGE (scatter gather entry) size.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
For example we are considering having an RX ring were you just post a list
of PFN's so a sge is only 8 bytes.

I might be wrong here, so please correct me if that's the not the case.
but I've gotten the impression that due to DPDK limitations you've focused 
on the use case where you have 1 SGE.
I'm not sure that a representative workload for network devices,
As LSO is an important offload.

And the storage guys also complained about this issue.

[I.L] PA?

[I.L] It might be that for virtio-net a single ring is better
But are you really going to argue that its better in all possible use cases?

[I.L] The device can do a single large read and do the parsing afterword's.
You could also use the doorbell to tell the device how much to read.

[I.L] I don't want to argue over the name. The main difference in my 
proposal is that the device doesn't need to write to the descriptor.
If it wants to you can define a separate bit for that.

[I.L] A completion is a used entry + device specific metadata.
I don't remember seeing an option to write used entries in a separate address,
I'll appreciate it if you can point me to the right direction.

Regarding the shared ring vs separate ring, I can't really argue with you
as I haven't done the relevant measurement.
I'm just saying it might not always be optimal in all use case,
So you should consider leaving both options open.

Its entirely possible that for virtio-net you want a single ring,
Where for PV-RDMA you want separate rings.
