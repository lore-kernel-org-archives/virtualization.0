    tun: export underlying socket
    
    Tun device looks similar to a packet socket
    in that both pass complete frames from/to userspace.
    
    This patch fills in enough fields in the socket underlying tun driver
    to support sendmsg/recvmsg operations, and message flags
    MSG_TRUNC and MSG_DONTWAIT, and exports access to this socket
    to modules.  Regular read/write behaviour is unchanged.
    
    This way, code using raw sockets to inject packets
    into a physical device, can support injecting
    packets into host network stack almost without modification.
    
    First user of this interface will be vhost virtualization
    accelerator.

commit 2c1566dc10c2dcacfbc386cae49d027b8e9e87df

    vhost_net: a kernel-level virtio server
    
    What it is: vhost net is a character device that can be used to reduce
    the number of system calls involved in virtio networking.
    Existing virtio net code is used in the guest without modification.
    
    There's similarity with vringfd, with some differences and reduced scope
    - uses eventfd for signalling
    - structures can be moved around in memory at any time (good for
      migration, bug work-arounds in userspace)
    - write logging is supported (good for migration)
    - support memory table and not just an offset (needed for kvm)
    
    common virtio related code has been put in a separate file vhost.c and
    can be made into a separate module if/when more backends appear.  I used
    Rusty's lguest.c as the source for developing this part : this supplied
    me with witty comments I wouldn't be able to write myself.
    
    What it is not: vhost net is not a bus, and not a generic new system
    call. No assumptions are made on how guest performs hypercalls.
    Userspace hypervisors are supported as well as kvm.
    
    How it works: Basically, we connect virtio frontend (configured by
    userspace) to a backend. The backend could be a network device, or a tap
    device.  Backend is also configured by userspace, including vlan/mac
    etc.
    
    Status: This works for me, and I haven't see any crashes.
    Compared to userspace, people reported improved latency (as I save up to
    4 system calls per packet), as well as better bandwidth and CPU
    utilization.
    
    Features that I plan to look at in the future:
    - mergeable buffers
    - zero copy
    - scalability tuning: figure out the best threading model to use
    
    Note on RCU usage (this is also documented in vhost.h, near
    private_pointer which is the value protected by this variant of RCU):
    what is happening is that the rcu_dereference() is being used in a
    workqueue item.  The role of rcu_read_lock() is taken on by the start of
    execution of the workqueue item, of rcu_read_unlock() by the end of
    execution of the workqueue item, and of synchronize_rcu() by
    flush_workqueue()/flush_work(). In the future we might need to apply
    some gcc attribute or sparse annotation to the function passed to
    INIT_WORK(). Paul's ack below is for this RCU usage.

    vhost: add missing architectures
    
    vhost is completely portable, but Kconfig include was missing for all
    architectures besides x86, so it did not appear in the menu.  Add the
    relevant Kconfig includes to all architectures that support
    virtualization.

    virtio: Add memory statistics reporting to the balloon driver (V4)
    
    Changes since V3:
     - Do not do endian conversions as they will be done in the host
     - Report stats that reference a quantity of memory in bytes
     - Minor coding style updates
    
    Changes since V2:
     - Increase stat field size to 64 bits
     - Report all sizes in kb (not pages)
     - Drop anon_pages stat and fix endianness conversion
    
    Changes since V1:
     - Use a virtqueue instead of the device config space
    
    When using ballooning to manage overcommitted memory on a host, a system for
    guests to communicate their memory usage to the host can provide information
    that will minimize the impact of ballooning on the guests.  The current method
    employs a daemon running in each guest that communicates memory statistics to a
    host daemon at a specified time interval.  The host daemon aggregates this
    information and inflates and/or deflates balloons according to the level of
    host memory pressure.  This approach is effective but overly complex since a
    daemon must be installed inside each guest and coordinated to communicate with
    the host.  A simpler approach is to collect memory statistics in the virtio
    balloon driver and communicate them directly to the hypervisor.
    
    This patch enables the guest-side support by adding stats collection and
    reporting to the virtio balloon driver.

    virtio: Fix scheduling while atomic in virtio_balloon stats
    
    This is a fix for my earlier patch: "virtio: Add memory statistics reporting to
    the balloon driver (V4)".
    
    I discovered that all_vm_events() can sleep and therefore stats collection
    cannot be done in interrupt context.  One solution is to handle the interrupt
    by noting that stats need to be collected and waking the existing vballoon
    kthread which will complete the work via stats_handle_request().  Rusty, is
    this a saner way of doing business?
    
    There is one issue that I would like a broader opinion on.  In stats_request, I
    update vb->need_stats_update and then wake up the kthread.  The kthread uses
    vb->need_stats_update as a condition variable.  Do I need a memory barrier
    between the update and wake_up to ensure that my kthread sees the correct
    value?  My testing suggests that it is not needed but I would like some
    confirmation from the experts.
