Thanks for your comment!

Eric mentioned a proposal that each virtio block device has its own *virtual*
keyslots in the host, which is not static partitioning of the physical keyslots.
I have concerns about the new key programing UAPI and 2 VM exits per encrypted
I/O. I'll confirm with Eric if that needs be considered and if we need pass
through the crypto to the host blk-crypto-profile (which means the max slots
of blk-crypto-profile in the guest is 0, and virtio block driver only doesn't
implement the key program interface in blk_crypto_ll_ops).

You're right. When the virtio-blk device processes encrypted I/O, it
would be responsible for extracting the blk_crypto_key and DUN from the
virtqueue and attaching them to the bio (via bio_crypt_set_ctx()). The
existing keyslot management logic in the block layer would then handle
physical keyslot allocation and waiting as needed, so the rest of the
blk-crypto infrastructure should continue to work unchanged.

Regarding your concern, there is already a somewhat similar
implementation in the device-mapper layer (
dm_table_construct_crypto_profile() implements a passthrough
blk_crypto_ll_ops profile. See
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/md/dm-table.c?h=v7.3-rc1
).

Based on my current understanding, I don't see any obvious
architectural issues with this approach. However, I may be missing
something, so I'd appreciate any feedback if you see flaws in the
design or potential problems that should be taken into account.
