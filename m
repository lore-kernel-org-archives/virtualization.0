Note that we fill a ring buffer at open time (try_fill_recv()),
all these buffers will be of the minimal size.

By the time we have refilled the ring buffer, EWMA value will be
GOOD_PACKET_LEN.

These sizes are a hint, clamped between 1500 and PAGE_SIZE.

We do not care of very first allocated buffers, they are good enough.

We only care of the million of following allocations.

Also note the EWMA is per queue, not global to the device.

Of course, there is no 'one size' perfect for all usages.
