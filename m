Hi Tony.
Could you give me comments/hints to make progress?
What do you think about those patches?
I believe that ia64/kvm and other ia64 virtualization technologies 
also can get much benefit from ia64/pv_ops and that no performance
penalties exist with CONFIG_PARAVIRT=n.

Regarding to the ia64/xen specific patches, should they go through
the xen maintainer like the ia64/kvm patches did?

thanks,
