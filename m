It does add some extra instruction that may slow it down slightly, but I 
don't agree that it gives nothing back. The cpu lock holder information 
can be useful in analyzing crash dumps and in some debugging situation. 
I think it can be useful in RHEL for this readon. How about an x86 
config option to allow distros to decide if they want to have it 
enabled? I will make sure that it will have no performance degradation 
if the option is not enabled.

Cheers,
