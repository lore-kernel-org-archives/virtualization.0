This patch looks OK to me.

I had run some microbenchmark on powerpc system with or w/o the patch.

On a 2-socket 160-thread SMT4 POWER9 system (not virtualized):

5.8.0-rc4
=========

Running locktest with spinlock [runtime = 10s, load = 1]
Threads = 160, Min/Mean/Max = 77,665/90,153/106,895

Running locktest with rwlock [runtime = 10s, r% = 50%, load = 1]

Threads = 40, Total Rate = 2,388 kop/s; Percpu Rate = 60 kop/s

5.8.0-rc4-qlock+
================

Running locktest with spinlock [runtime = 10s, load = 1]
Threads = 160, Min/Mean/Max = 123,835/124,580/124,587
Threads = 160, Total Rate = 1,992 kop/s; Percpu Rate = 12 kop/s

Running locktest with rwlock [runtime = 10s, r% = 50%, load = 1]
Threads = 160, Min/Mean/Max = 254,210/264,714/276,784
Threads = 160, Total Rate = 4,231 kop/s; Percpu Rate = 26 kop/s

Running locktest with spinlock [runtime = 10s, load = 1]
Threads = 80, Min/Mean/Max = 599,715/603,397/603,450
Threads = 80, Total Rate = 4,825 kop/s; Percpu Rate = 60 kop/s

Running locktest with rwlock [runtime = 10s, r% = 50%, load = 1]
Threads = 80, Min/Mean/Max = 492,687/525,224/567,456
Threads = 80, Total Rate = 4,199 kop/s; Percpu Rate = 52 kop/s

Running locktest with spinlock [runtime = 10s, load = 1]
Threads = 40, Min/Mean/Max = 1,325,623/1,325,628/1,325,636
Threads = 40, Total Rate = 5,299 kop/s; Percpu Rate = 132 kop/s

Running locktest with rwlock [runtime = 10s, r% = 50%, load = 1]
Threads = 40, Min/Mean/Max = 1,249,731/1,292,977/1,342,815
Threads = 40, Total Rate = 5,168 kop/s; Percpu Rate = 129 kop/s

On systems on large number of cpus, qspinlock lock is faster and more fair.

With some tuning, we may be able to squeeze out more performance.
