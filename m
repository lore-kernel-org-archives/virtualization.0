My pathetic attempt to benchmark it came up with no difference.
What's the right benchmark?  I'm having trouble compiling anything in
tools/virtio -- my patch breaks that code, but it seems like it's
already broken.  The next version of my patches will at least not make
the problem worse.

I think that we can eliminate any possibility of a meaningful
performance hit due to the streaming part of the mappings by checking
PCI_DMA_BUS_IS_PHYS.  I'll test and send out a version of the patches
that does that.

For what it's worth, there's another possible performance hit: on some
architectures, coherent memory could be uncached.  This might not
matter for anyone, though.  I think that x86 uses normal memory for
coherent mappings.  ARM is unlikely to make serious use of virtio_pci,
since AFAIK virtio_mmio is strongly preferred on ARM.  s390 should be
unaffected for much the same reason.  Are there other architectures on
which this could be a problem?

It's possible that the weak barrier flag could be used to disable the
use of coherent memory, but it might require some DMA API trickery.
In particular, the only API I see is DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL, and we'll end
up with ugly code in virtio_pci to get it working.

Ultimately, I think that hypervisors need a way to tell their guests
that certain PCI devices are emulated and therefore fully coherent
regardless our normal architectural considerations.
