I agree (especially regarding the arm64 DIMM hotplug discussion).
However, for the two cases

a) dax/kmem
b) virtio-mem

We really want to let the driver take back control and figure out "what
to do with the memory".

I'm sorry if that was confusing, I tried to stress that kmem and
virtio-mem is special in the description.

I squeezed a lot of that information into the cover letter and into
patch #3.

Yes, and I think kmem took an excellent approach of explicitly putting
that "System RAM" into a resource hierarchy. That "System RAM" won't
show up as a root node under /proc/iomem (see patch #3), which already
results in kexec-tools to treat it in a special way. I am thinking about
doing the same for virtio-mem.

I can certainly rephrase the subject/description/comment, stating that
this is not to be used for ordinary hotplugged DIMMs - only when the
device driver is under control to decide what to do with that memory -
especially when kexec'ing.

(previously, I called this flag MHP_DRIVER_MANAGED, but I think
MHP_NO_FIRMWARE_MEMMAP is clearer, we just need a better description)

Would that make it clearer?

Thanks!
