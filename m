I read the discussions and understood the reasons.

I understand that controlling threads with their parent through the 
common mm_struct is useful and in some sense reasonable. But the 
following situation seems to me little bit confusing.

TWO POSSIBLE WAYS OF CONTROL -- after the parent process was moved
===================================================================
NEW group: [parent process]----> COMMON mm_struct
                              |
OLD group: [threads]---------+

Threads can be
1. grouped by OLD group
2. (virtually) grouped by mm_struct
    --> same as grouped by NEW group
===================================================================
