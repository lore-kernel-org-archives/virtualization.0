That is why I pushed for what is becoming dev_forward_skb.  So that
we have one place where we can make all of those tweaks.  It seems
like in every review we find another field that should be cleared/handled
specially.

I don't quite follow what you intend with dev_queue_xmit when the macvlan
is in one namespace and the real physical device is in another.  Are
you mentioning that the packet classifier runs in the namespace where
the primary device lives with packets from a different namespace?
