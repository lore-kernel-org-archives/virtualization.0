This path in virtio net is also unused on modern hypervisors, so we probably
don't care how well does it perform: why not apply it anyway?
It's the virtio_ring changes that we need to worry about.

I think that's down to the fact that it's out of line,
so it prevents inlining of the caller.

Right but we'd have to fix that before applying the patches
to avoid performance regressions.
