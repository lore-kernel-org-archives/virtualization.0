        Yes, I saw some line wraps in what I received, but I checked
the original draft to be sure and they weren't there. Possibly from
the relay; Sigh.

I had to add this to avoid an infinite loop when I wrote a bad
packet on the socket. I agree error handling needs a better look,
but retrying a bad packet continuously while dumping in the log
is what it was doing when I hit an error before this code. Isn't
this better, at least until a second look?

        I was looking at alternatives to adding the lock in the
first place, but I found I couldn't measure a difference in the
cost with and without the lock.

        Yes; we have hdr_size, so I can add it here. It'll be 0 for
the cases where the backend and guest both have vnet header (either
the regular or larger mergeable buffers one), but should be added
in for future raw socket support.

        This is to prevent a spin loop in the case where we have some
buffers available, but not enough for the current packet (ie, this
is the replacement code for the "rxmaxheadcount" business). If they
actually added something new, retrying once should see it, but what
vhost_enable_notify() returns non-zero on is not "new buffers" but
rather "not empty". In the case mentioned, we aren't empty, so
vhost_enable_notify() returns nonzero every time, but the guest hasn't
given us enough buffers to proceed, so we continuously retry; this
code breaks the spin loop until we've really got new buffers from
the guest.

        I had a printk in there to test the code and with the
retries counter, it happens when we fill the ring (once,
because of the retries checks), and then proceeds as
desired when the guest gives us more buffers. Without the
check, it spews until we hear from the guest.

        OK, but this is the original code, unchanged by my patch. :-)

        This adds mergeable buffer support for the raw case.

        This sets num_buffers for the tap case (where hdr_size is 0).
We don't copy any headers at all for this case, but we need to
add num_buffers at offset 10 in the user buffer already read by
recvmsg().

        rcvmsg() can never modify the iovec; it's the
standard socket call. To use vq->hdr, we'd have to copy
it in from user space, modify it, and then copy it back
in to user space, on every packet. In the normal tap case,
hdr_size is 0 and we read it directly from the socket to
user space. It is already correct for mergeable buffers,
except for the num_buffers value added here.

        I'll recheck this -- I'll make the type of "headcount" be
the type of "num_buffers" in the MRXB vnet header, if it isn't
already.

        Because this overwrites the valid vnet header we got from
the tap socket with a local copy that isn't correct. For this to
work, we first need to copy_from_user() the vnet header from the
socket into vq->hdr (on every packet).
        It doesn't assume anything here-- it requires (and checks)
that the user didn't give us a <12 byte buffer, which I think is
reasonable. That's about the size of the descriptor for the buffer,
and I'd call that a broken guest. The cost of supporting those
tiny buffers in the general case would be a copy_from_user() and
copy_to_user() of the vnet_hdr on every packet, which I think is
not worth it (and especially since I don't expect any guest is
ever going to give us a <12 byte buffer in the first place).

        This is like malloc -- "0" is never a valid return value, and
we don't have actual error values to return and handle; they generate
vq_err() messages within the code itself. In all cases,
it is the count of buffers we allocated (which is 0 when we fail to
allocate). So, I don't agree with this, but can do it if you insist.

        The external code only calls vhost_add_used_and_signal(), so I
split that. I can add a single variant of vhost_add_used() too, but
I was trying to avoid adding duplicate code and external interface.
I don't actually agree with splitting these; isn't it better to have
them going through the same code path whether it's single or multiple?
A bug in one would show up as an intermittent failure, and a change
to one requires changing both. I don't think the multiple should just
do the single repeatedly, either, since the multiple variant now can
do the work in one or two copy_to_user()'s, without a loop; so splitting
these just makes a special case for single to carry in code maintenance
with no benefit, I think.
