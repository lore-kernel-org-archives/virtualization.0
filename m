Why don't you Cc all maintainers on this email?
Pls check the file MAINTAINERS for the full list.
I added Cc for now.

So you changed code to make it think we are out of capacity, now it
stops the queue.

and changed it here so it won't restart queue if host consumed
all buffers.
unsurprisingly this makes driver not work.

With or without your changes?
Is this the condition you describe?


        if (sq->vq->num_free < 2+MAX_SKB_FRAGS) {

---> at this point, skb_xmit_done runs. this does:
        /* Suppress further interrupts. */
        virtqueue_disable_cb(vq);

        /* We were probably waiting for more output buffers. */
        netif_wake_subqueue(vi->dev, vq2txq(vq));
--->



                netif_stop_subqueue(dev, qnum);

---> queue is now stopped

                if (unlikely(!virtqueue_enable_cb_delayed(sq->vq))) {

----> this re-enables interrupts, after an interrupt skb_xmit_done
	will run again.

                        /* More just got used, free them then recheck.
 * */
                        free_old_xmit_skbs(sq);
                        if (sq->vq->num_free >= 2+MAX_SKB_FRAGS) {
                                netif_start_subqueue(dev, qnum);
                                virtqueue_disable_cb(sq->vq);
                        }
                }
        }


I can't see a race condition from your description above.

I can't say what does your code-changing experiment show.
It might be better to introduce delay by calling something like
cpu_relax at specific points (maybe multiple times in a loop).
