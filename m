You're not supposed to do it still, that's right.

If the driver returns NETDEV_TX_BUSY it means that it is not
maintaining the TX queues stop/start state properly.

It was kept around for drivers that we didn't want to convert
or fix up at the time (this is circa two decades ago).

I realize that there are situations for some devices where this is
difficult to achieve, but the stack really does a non-trivial amount
of useless work if you don't play along nicely.

If you grep drivers/net for it, the majority of the returns are in
assertion failure paths in the TX handler of those drivers.
NETDEV_TX_BUSY is not being returned in a normal path of operation.

No, it doesn't.
