Hmm that's not explicit enough, someone might enable CONFIG_STAGING for
some other reason and won't notice the dependency.
We need it to appear with other staging drivers in the menu,
so there needs to be a Kconfig that is included from
drivers/staging/Kconfig.

For example, we can create
drivers/vhost/staging/Kconfig or drivers/vhost/tcm/Kconfig and include
it from drivers/staging/Kconfig.  nouveau did something like this for a
while, see f3c93cbde7eab38671ae085cb1027b08f5f36757.

No need to move the rest of the code.
