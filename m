That's correct, Jeremy put it as well as I could, VMI was always a
optimization, and we expect that new HW features bridge that performance
gap too. So a generic kernel will run just as well on VMware's platform.

Having said that, I would like to clarify that existing products which
support VMI will still carry on supporting it for the current customer
base. Its only the new products which will stop supporting this feature.

Yep that's true.
