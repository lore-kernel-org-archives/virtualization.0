During link announcement, driver needs a method to notify device that it has
received the notification and let it clear the VIRITO_NET_S_ANNOUNCE bit in the
status field. Doing this through a dedicated command looks suitable for all
platforms (especially for the ones who don't trap the status read or write) with
a ctrl vq and can solve the race between host and guest.

So this patch makes VIRTIO_NET_F_ANNOUNCE depends on VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_VQ and
introduces a dedicated command VIRTIO_NET_CTRL_ANNOUNCE_ACK to let device clear
the VIRTIO_NET_S_ANNOUNCE bit in the status field.
