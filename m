I missed the fact that vp_free_vectors() conditionally sets
msix_enabled=0.  It seems a bit cludgy especially since it is called
both before and after setting msix_enabled=1.

I ran into a number of weird problems due to read/write reordering
that was causing this code path to fail.  The impact was
non-deterministic.  I'll go back and try to better understand what
code path is causing it.

I don't understand this comment.  How is the work done in this path
any different from what's done in vp_free_vectors()?
