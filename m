Yep, it is technically difficult, but as cloud providers we would like
to take actions to address use case for our own if no one else is
willing to do so. However we're not seeking complicated design or
messing up the others such as your use case. As this is the first time
a real patch of the PV failover approach, although having be discussed
for years, posted to the mailing list. All voices suddenly came over,
various parties wish their specific needs added to the todo list, it's
indeed hard to accommodate all at once in the first place. I went
through same tough period of time while I was doing similar work so I
completely understand that. The task is not easy for sure. :)

The attempts I made was trying to consolidate all potential use cases
into one single solution rather than diverge from the very beginning.
It's in the phase of RFC and I don't want to wait expressing our
interest until very late.

Not exactly, this will be positioned as an optimization, but it is
crucial to our use case. While for the generic case with non-equal HW,
we can find out the least common denominator and apply those configs
that the new VF or the para virt driver can support without comprising
too much.

OK. But will you plan to address the former: transparently provide
support for existing network configuration with separate patches in
future? Say if go with your 2 netdevs approach.

I'm not particularly sure about this use case for how the host is
capable of doing guest tuning/optimization, since you may be just
passing a pass-through device to the guest. Or are you talking about
VF specifically?

OK. For your use case that's fine. But that's too specific scenario
with lots of restrictions IMHO, perhaps very few users will benefit
from it, I'm not sure. If you're unwilling to move towards it, we'd
take this one and come back with a generic solution that is able to
address general use cases for VF/PT live migration .
