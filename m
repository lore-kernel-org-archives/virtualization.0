Specifically I was working with bond. I had overlooked team for the
most part since it required an additional userspace daemon which
basically broke our requirement of no user-space intervention.

I was trying to focus on just doing an active/backup setup. The
problem is there are debugfs, sysfs, and procfs interfaces exposed
that we don't need and/or want. Adding any sort of interface to
exclude these would just bloat up the bonding driver, and leaving them
in would just be confusing since they would all need to be ignored. In
addition the steps needed to get the name to come out the same as the
original virtio interface would just bloat up bonding.

I used the expression "for now" as I see this being the first stage of
a multi-stage process.

Step 1 is to get a basic virtio-bypass driver added to virtio so that
it is at least comparable to netvsc in terms of feature set and
enables basic network live migration.

Step 2 is adding some sort of dirty page tracking, preferably via
something like a paravirtual iommu interface. Once we have that we can
defer the eviction of the VF until the very last moment of the live
migration. For now I need to work on testing a modification to allow
mapping the entire guest as being pass-through for DMA to the device,
and requiring dynamic for any DMA that is bidirectional or from the
device.

Step 3 will be to start looking at advanced configuration. That is
where we drop the implementation in step 1 and instead look at
spawning something that looks more like the team type interface,
however instead of working with a user-space daemon we would likely
need to work with some sort of mailbox or message queue coming up from
the hypervisor. Then we can start looking at doing things like passing
up blocks of eBPF code to handle Tx port selection or whatever we
need.

You started mentioning much more complex configurations such as
multi-VF, LACP, and other such things. I fully own that this cannot
support that. My understanding is that the netvsc solution that is out
there cannot support anything like that either. The idea for now is to
keep this as simple as possible. It makes things like the possibility
of porting this to other OSes much easier.

So I have a question for you. Why did you create the team driver? The
bonding code was already there and does almost exactly the same thing.
I would think it has to do with where things are managed. That is the
same situation we have with this.

In my mind I don't see this something where we can just fit it into
one of these two drivers because of the same reason the bonding and
team drivers are split. We want to manage this interface somewhere
else. In my mind what we probably need to do is look at refactoring
the code since the control paths are in different locations for each
of these drivers, but much of the datapath is the same. That is where
I see things going eventually for this "virtio-bond" interface I
referenced, but for now this interface is not that since there isn't
really any communication channel present at all.
