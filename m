KY,

instead of using system() in kvp_get_ipconfig_info and kvp_set_ip_info,
wouldnt it be easier to call an external helper script which does all
the distribution specific work? Just define some API to pass values to
the script, and something to read values collected by the script back
into the daemon.

If the work is done in a script it will be much easier for an admin to
debug and adjust it.

I think there is no standard way to configure all relevant distros in
the same way. Maybe one day NetworkManager can finally handle all
possible ways to configure network related things. But until that
happens the config files need to be adjusted manually.



Some of the functions have deep indention levels due to 'while() {
switch() }' usage. Perhaps such code could be moved into its own
function so that lines dont need to be wrapped that much due to the odd
80 column limit.
