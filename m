I'll have to do some research and get back to you with our final
decision on this. There was some internal resistance to splitting out
this code as a separate module, but I think it would need to happen in
order to support multiple drivers.

Also I would be curious how Stephen feels about this. Would the
sharing of the dev, and the use of the phys_port_name on the
base/backup netdev work for netvsc? It seems like it should get them
performance gains on the VF, but I am not sure if there are any
specific requirements that mandated that they had to have 2 netdevs.

Thanks.
