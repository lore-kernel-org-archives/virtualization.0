OK, but in that case one wonders whether we should do more to free memory?

E.g. imagine that we dropped a packet of a specific TCP flow
because we couldn't allocate a new packet.

What happens now is that the old packet is freed as well.

So quite likely the next packet in queue will get processed
since it will reuse the memory we have just freed.

The next packet and the next after it etc all will have to go through
the net stack until they get at the socket and are dropped then
because we missed a segment.  Even worse, GRO gets disabled so the load
on receiver goes up instead of down.

Sounds like a problem doesn't it?

GRO actually detects it's the same flow and can see packet is
out of sequence. Why doesn't it drop the packet then?
Alternatively, we could (for example using the pre-allocated skb
like I suggested) notify GRO that it should start dropping packets
of this flow.

What do you think?
