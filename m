How exactly does one not advertise an IOMMU for a specific
device? Could you please clarify?

One simple fix is to defer this all until virtio 1.0.
virtio 1.0 has an alternative set of IDs for virtio pci,
that can be used if you are making an incompatible change.
We can use that if there's an iommu.
