That is completely wrong.  All aspects of the DMA API are about the
system they are used in.  The CPU, the PCIe root complex, interconnects.

All the issues I mentioned in my previous mail exist in realy life
systems that you can plug virtio PCI or PCIe cards into.

The flag as defined in the spec is the wrong thing to set, because they
are not using an iommu.  They probably don't even do any address
translation.

And the explanation.

Hell no.  DMA API = abstraction for any possble platform wart.
We are not going to make this any more fine grained.  It is bad
enough that virtio already has a mode bypassing any of this,
we are not going to make even more of a mess of it.

Right now it means implementing a virtual iommu, which I agree is
way too much overhead.

Of course it matters.  If the device always needs an offset in
the DMA addresses it is completely related to DMA.

For some examples take a look at:

  arch/x86/pci/sta2x11-fixup.c
  arch/mips/include/asm/mach-ath25/dma-coherence.h

or anything setting dma_pfn_offset.

VIRTIO_F_BEHAVES_LIKE_A_REAL_PCI_DEVICE_DONT_TRY_TO_OUTSMART_ME

as said it's not just translations, it is cache coherence as well.

That sounds like a qemu implementation bug.  If qemu knowns that
guest physiscall == guest dma space there is no need to check.

No.  I mean the fact that PCI(e) devices often are not coherent with
the cache.  So you need to writeback the cpu cache before transferring
data to the device, and invalidate the cpu cache before transferring
data from the device.  Plus additional workarounds for speculation.

Looks at the implementations and comments around the dma_sync_*
calls.

Virtually indexed, virtually tagged.  In short you must do cache
maintainance based on the virtual address used to fill the cache.

Because for example your PCIe root complex only supports 32-bit
addressing, but the memory buffer is outside the addressing range.

This is write combibining in the SOC with the root complex.  Nothing
your can work around in the device or device driver.
