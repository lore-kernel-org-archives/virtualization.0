BTW, yes.  But it's a weird way to express what the nic is doing.

You mean "RX follows TX"?  ie. accelerated RFS.  I agree.

Perhaps Tom can explain how we avoid out-of-order receive for the
accelerated RFS case?  It's not clear to me, but we need to be able to
do that for virtio-net if it implements accelerated RFS.

Implying the receive queue by xmit will be slightly laggy.  Don't know
if that's a problem.

Cheers,
