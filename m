In this patch yes, but a later patch adds a condition:

-       if (flags & FOLL_GET) {
+       if ((flags & FOLL_GET) || (vma->vm_flags & VM_LOCKED)) {

Fixed.

That is a major nit. This should be an #ifdef. In previous versions the
complete "if (!pte_present(*pte)) { }" is ifdefed, the later versions
use the !spin_is_locked condition. Only I forgot to invert the #ifndef.
Fixed.

I take the small review anytime. Already found one major nit.
