Dan, 

Sorry I could not get back to you earlier. You are right, in that I am trusting
the host! I am of the firm belief that in a virtualized environment, if you don't trust
the host, there is not a whole lot you can do in a guest! I have had this arguments 
with other on this mailing list in the past. Having said that, I think we have spent more
time debating this than we should; your proposal is reasonable and I will go ahead and
re-spin those patches based on your comments. I should be posting them shortly.

Regards,

K. Y
