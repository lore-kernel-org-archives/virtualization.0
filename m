The idea is to allow programs to implement arbitrary kinds of
encapsulation, so we need to be able to allow them to push headers for
all kinds of software tunnels, with allowance for a few depths in some
extreme cases.

In that light, a nice round power of 2 number such as 256 seems quite
reasonable to me.

This seems to be what other XDP implementations in drivers use at the
moment as well.
