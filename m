All the above measurements are on PLE machine. It is 32 vcpu single
guest on a 8 pcpu.

(PS:One problem I saw in my kernbench run itself is that
number of threads spawned = 20 instead of 2* number of vcpu. I ll
correct during next measurement.)

"even quite small amounts of overcommit lead to large performance drops
with non-pv ticket locks":

This is very much true on non PLE machine. probably compilation takes
even a day vs just one hour. ( with just 1:3x overcommit I had got 25 x
speedup).
