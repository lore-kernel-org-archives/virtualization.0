Xen does expose dma_ops.  The trick is knowing when to use it.

The devices I care about aren't actually Xen devices.  They're devices
supplied by QEMU/KVM, booting a Xen hypervisor, which in turn passes
the virtio device (along with every other PCI device) through to dom0.
So this is exactly the same virtio device that regular x86 KVM guests
would see.  The reason that current code fails is that Xen guest
physical addresses aren't the same as the addresses seen by the outer
hypervisor.

These devices don't know that physical addresses != bus addresses, so
they can't advertise that fact.

If we ever end up with a virtio_pci device with physical addressing,
behind an IOMMU (but ignoring it), on Xen, we'll have a problem, since
neither "physical" addressing nor dma ops will work.

That being said, there are also proposals for virtio devices supplied
by Xen dom0 to domU, and these will presumably work the same way,
except that the device implementation will know that it's on Xen.

Grr.  This is mostly a result of the fact that virtio_pci devices
aren't really PCI devices.  I still think that virtio_pci shouldn't
have to worry about this; ideally this would all be handled higher up
in the device hierarchy.  x86 already gets this right.


Are there any hypervisors except PPC that use virtio_pci, have IOMMUs
on the pci slot that virtio_pci lives in, and that use physical
addressing?  If not, I think that just quirking PPC will work (at
least until someone wants IOMMU support in virtio_pci on PPC, in which
case doing something using devicetree seems like a reasonable
solution).
