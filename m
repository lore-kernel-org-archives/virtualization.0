You can avoid PLE by not issuing PAUSE instructions when spinning.  You
may want to consider this if you have a lock that explicitly deschedules
the VCPU while waiting (or just deschedule before PLE would trigger).

I think you should deschedule all waiters.

The goal of PV aware locks is to improve performance when locks are
contented /and/ VCPUs are over-committed.  Is this something you're
actually measuring?  It's not clear to me.
