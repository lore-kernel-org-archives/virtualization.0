The patch won't affect native performance unless the kernel is built 
with VIRT_UNFAIR_LOCKS selected. The same is also true when 
PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS is selected. There is no way around that.

I do agree that I may over-engineer on this patch, but my main purpose 
is to achieve the best possible performance and so may sacrifice 
simplicity in some cases. Still allowing lock stealing in the fastpath 
is already much simpler than what my original patch was doing with lock 
stealing in the slowpath. If you still think it is too complex, I am 
willing to take that out if it is what I need to get your approval.

Please also review the rests of the pvspinlock patches and let me know 
if you have other comments. I would like to have one more version to go 
and be done with it.

Thanks,
Longman
