Hi,

About this problem I have a talk with Li Liu. As MST said, we could use
multiple GSI to support vhost-net with irqfd. And we have figured out a way
to solve this problem. The method is as same as virtio-pci which is to assign
multiple irqs for virtio-mmio. Also it can support multiqueue virtio-net on arm.

Would you have a look at this method? Thank you very much.
