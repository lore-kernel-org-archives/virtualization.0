It's very surprising no one couldn't.  I did above, I try again below.
Note: below discusses configuration *within guest*.

Example: you have a mix of assigned devices and virtio devices. You
don't trust your assigned device vendor not to corrupt your memory so
you want to limit the damage your assigned device can do to your guest,
so you use an IOMMU for that.  Thus existing iommu=pt within guest is out.

But you trust your hypervisor (you have no choice anyway),
and you don't want the overhead of tweaking IOMMU
on data path for virtio. Thus iommu=on is out too.

Isn't this specified by the hypervisor? I don't think this is a good way
to do this: guest security should be up to guest.

I'm not sure what ACPI has to do with it.
It's about a way for guest users to specify whether
they want to bypass an IOMMU for a given device.

By the way, a bunch of code is missing on the QEMU side
to make this useful:
1. virtio ignores the iommu
2. vhost user ignores the iommu
3. dataplane ignores the iommu
4. vhost-net ignores the iommu
5. VFIO ignores the iommu

I think so far I only saw patches for 1 above.
