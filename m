I think you're right about pci_sriov_configure_simple
isn't designed for this case. I dropped the use of
pci_sriov_configure_simple in v2. Thanks!

I think it's OK to accept this feature bit in this case.
The IOV support not enabled in kernel just means there is
no way for users to use SR-IOV. But it doesn't mean that
the virtio driver doesn't understand *this feature bit*.
Even if the IOV support is enabled in kernel, there is
still no way for virtio driver to know whether users will
enable VFs or not. Accepting this feature is to tell the
device the virtio driver understands this feature (i.e.
this is not an incompatible virtio driver). And it's not
to tell the device whether users will enable VFs or not,
or how many VFs will be enabled.

Right. Thanks!

FYI, here is v2:
