Thanks for writing that code. It should be an interesting alternative
on boxes where firescope doesn't work.

I hope I can eventually merge early firewire support code too.

This needs a CONFIG_* at least. And some documentation on how to set it
up on both sides.

But not merged yet, right? I was hoping it could be done from
user space anyways.

That's nasty. Any way to work around that?

Can you put it in a separate file please?
Perhaps with a little abstraction in drivers/usb ?

But you don't?

This should be probably merged into the early quirks loop

usb would seem to be more intuitive
