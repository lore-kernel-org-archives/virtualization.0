I dug in the code and I have some comments about it, but before
I post them I was wondering if you have any plans to run any performance
tests against the PV ticketlock with normal and over-committed scenarios?

Looking at this with a pen and paper I see that compared to
PV ticketlock for the CPUs that are contending on the queue (so they
go to pv_wait_head_and_link, then progress to pv_wait_head), they
go sleep twice and get woken up twice. In PV ticketlock the
contending CPUs would only go to sleep once and woken up once it
was their turn.

That of course is the worst case scenario - where the CPU
that has the lock is taking forever to do its job and the
host is quite overcommitted.

Thanks!
