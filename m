It is __queue_spin_unlock.  But you're right:

... indeed the __queue_spin_unlock/pv_kick_node pair is only done if the
waiter has already written _QSPINLOCK_LOCKED_SLOWPATH, and this means
that the lock holder must also observe PV_CPU_HALTED.

So this is correct:

>> Nothing protects from writing qlock->lock before pv->cpustate is read,

but this cannot happen:

Yes.

This is okay.  The kick_cpu hypercall is sticky until the next halt, if
no halt is pending.  Otherwise, pv ticketlocks would have the same issue.
