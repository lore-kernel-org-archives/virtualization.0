Both are correct descriptions of typical behaviors. But it isn't spec'ed 
anywhere who has to do the buffer allocation.

In practical terms, the buffer allocation happens in either the 2D GUI 
toolkit (gtk+, for example), or the EGL implementation. Someone using 
this in a real product would most probably be interested in avoiding any 
extra copies and make sure that both allocate buffers via virtio-gpu, for 
example.

Depending on the use case, they could be also interested in supporting 
unmodified clients with an extra copy per buffer presentation.

That's to say that if we cannot come up with a zero-copy solution for 
unmodified clients, we should at least support zero-copy for cooperative 
clients.

Yep.

Yep.

As per the above, the GUI toolkit could have been modified so the client 
directly creates a shareable buffer, and renders directly to it without 
any extra copies.

If clients cannot be modified, then it's the guest proxy what has to 
create the shareable buffer and keep it in sync with the client's 
non-shareable buffer at the right times, by intercepting 
wl_surface.commit messages and copying buffer contents.

How can KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION ever be safely used then? I would have 
expected that callers of that ioctl have enough knowledge to be able to 
choose a physical address that won't conflict with the guest's kernel.

I see that the ivshmem device in QEMU registers the memory region in BAR 
2 of a PCI device instead. Would that be better in your opinion?

The latter:
