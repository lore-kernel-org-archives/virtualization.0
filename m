I don't think that's true, and that's not what we currently implement in
the hypervisor for speeding up migration. I still consider
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT as an alternative technique of
temporarily inflating/deflating. E.g., we don't migrate any of these
pages in the hypervisor, so the content will be zeroed out on the
migration target. If migration fails, the ld content will remain. You
can call that "corrupting memory" - it's exactly what it has been
invented for.


IIRC we decided to glue the semantics of VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON to
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT, which makes in my opinion perfect sense.

So I propose:

VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON not implemented in the hypervisor:
- Pages inflated/deflated via VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT will
  either have the old page content or will be filled with 0.
- This matches what we currently do.

VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON implemented in the hypervisor:
- Pages inflated/deflated via VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT will
  either have the old page content or will be filled with poison_val.
- This matches what we should do also during ordinary
  inflation/deflation and free page reporting.

Again, nothing is currently broken as we free_page() the pages and don't
care about an eventually changed page content. It's only relevant once
we ant to change that - and then we can rely on
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON.

Yes, for now. We should at some point change the guest to avoid
re-poisoning/zeroing by not using free_page(). For now, I don't think
there is anything broken, it's just not as efficient as it could get at
this point - tolerable as we don't usually expect our guests to poison
pages or per-initialize them with zero.
