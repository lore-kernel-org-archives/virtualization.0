Above should have been in your TL;DR;->

LD_PRELOAD is also horrible because of the granularity of the socket
calls;
Having things in the kernel and specifically tagging socket as needing
this feature is much much more manageable.

Tying things to virtualization may miss the big picture because there
are many other use cases for intercepting socket calls, example:
Samir Bellabes <sam@synack.fr> has been trying to get what he refers to
as "personal firewall" (equivalent to the silly windows firewall) which
prompts the user "ping from blah, do you want to allow a response?"
That requires intercepting send/recv calls, prompt the user in possibly
some pop-up and act based on response. It requires looking at content.
He is trying to use selinux for that interface,
but i think this would be the right abstraction.
I hope you plan to support send/recv.
I also hope you add support for SOCK_RAW (and maybe SOCK_PACKET).

Q: If you want this to be transparent to the apps, who/what is doing
the tagging of SOCK_HWASSIST? clearly not the app if you dont want to
change it.

I like the uri abstraction if it doesnt come at the expense of the
app transparency.
