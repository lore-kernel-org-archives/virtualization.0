Even though the owner is overwritten soon at writing, I'm not sure why
inserting the hook here causes the misleading. I think that it is easy
to understand when and where the owner is set by blkio-cgroup, and it
does not decrease maintainability, rather than put many hooks to each
caller.

dm-ioband gives high priority to I/O for swap-out by checking whether
PG_swapcache flag is set on the I/O page, regardless of the assigned
I/O bandwidth, and the bandwidth consumed for swap-out is charged to
the owner of the pages as a debt.
How about this approach?
