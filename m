Hi all:

This series introduces the support for rx busy polling support. This
was useful for reduing the latency for a kvm guest. Patch 1-2
introduces helpers which is used for rx busy polling. Patch 3
implement the main function.

Test was done between a kvm guest and an external host. Two hosts were
connected through 40gb mlx4 cards. With both busy_poll and busy_read are
set to 50 in guest, 1 byte netperf tcp_rr shows 116% improvement:
transaction rate was increased from 9151.94 to 19787.37.

Changes from V1:
- split the patch info smaller ones
- add more details about test setup/configuration

Please review.

Jason Wang (3):
  virtio-net: introduce helpers to enable and disable all NAPIs
  virtio-net: introduce virtnet_receive()
  virtio-net: rx busy polling support
