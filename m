Yes. For example look at gup_pmd_range. Here several checks are made on the pmd.
It is important the the check for pmd_none is made on the same value than
the check for pmd_trans_huge, but it is not important that the value is still up
to date. 
And there are really cases where we cannot read the  thing atomically, e.g. on 
m68k and sparc(32bit) pmd_t is defined as array of longs.

Another problem is that a compiler can implement the following code as 2 memory
reads (e.g. if you have compare instructions that work on memory) instead of a 
memory read and 2 compares

int check(unsigned long *value_p) {
	unsigned long value = *value_p;
	if (condition_a(value))
		return 1;
	if (condition_b(value))
		return 2;
	return 3;
}

With READ_ONCE you forbid that. In past times you would have used barrier() after 
the assignment to achieve the same goal.


> Are there assumptions these are two 32 bit reads?

It depends on the code. Some places (e.g. in gup) assumes that the access via
READ_ONCE is atomic (which it is for sane compilers as long as the pointer
is <= word size). In some others places just one bit is tested.
