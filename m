Stefan posted the QEMU vhost-scsi patches a few items, but I think it's
been awhile since the last round of review.  For the recent
development's with tcm_vhost, I've been using Zhi's QEMU tree here:

https://github.com/wuzhy/qemu/tree/vhost-scsi

Other than a few printf I added to help me understand how it works, no
function changes have been made to work with target-pending/tcm_vhost.

Thank you,
