Hi Dave.
Sorry about that.

The problem I had in the past is that vger rejects email with
too many CC addresses.

(It also rejected email with __smp_XXX in the subject
suspecting it's spam :( )

I'll look for better solutions next time - for now, would it help if I
bounced the whole patchset to you?
