Cosmetic, but probably "goto release_node" would be more consistent.

And I am wondering how much this "qsval >> _QCODE_OFFSET" check can help.
Note that this is the only usage of this arg, perhaps it would be better
to simply remove it and shrink the caller's code a bit? It is also used
in 3/8, but we can read the "fresh" value of ->qlcode (trylock does this
anyway), and perhaps it can actually help if it is already unlocked.

You know, actually I started this email because I thought that "goto notify_next"
is wrong, I misread the patch as if this "goto" can happen even if prev_qcode != 0.

So feel free to ignore, all my comments are cosmetic/subjective, but to me it
would be more clean/clear to rewrite the code above as

	if (prev_qcode == 0) {
		if (atomic_cmpxchg(..., _QSPINLOCK_LOCKED) == my_qcode)
			goto release_node;
		goto notify_next;
	}

	if (prev_qcode & _QSPINLOCK_LOCKED)
		prev_qcode &= ~_QSPINLOCK_LOCKED;
	else
		queue_spin_unlock(lock);

I guess this is for 3/8which adds the optimized version of
queue_get_lock_qcode(), so perhaps this "retval < 0" block can go into 3/8
as well.

OTOH, at least the generic (non-optimized) version of queue_spin_setlock()
could probably accept "qcode" and avoid atomic_read() + _QSPINLOCK_LOCKED
check.

But once again, please feel free to ignore.

Oleg.
