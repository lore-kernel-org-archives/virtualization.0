Agreed, virtio-iommu is expected to be implemented on virtio 1 and
later. I'll remove the two legacy-related paragraph from the spec and
add a check in the driver as you suggested, to avoid giving the wrong idea.

That is curious, given that the virtio_mmio driver supports virtio 1 and
from my own experience, porting the MMIO transport to virtio 1 only
requires updating a few registers, when ANY_LAYOUT, modern virtqueue and
status are already implemented.

Sorry, which part do you have in mind? The spec does provide both a
legacy and modern register layout, with version numbers to differentiate
them.

Having the IOMMU outside PCI seems more common though. On Arm and Intel
the IOMMU doesn't have a PCI config space, BARs or capabilities, just a
plain MMIO region and a static number of interrupts. However the AMD
IOMMU appears as a PCI device with additional MMIO registers. I would be
interested in implementing virtio-iommu as a PCI dev at some point, at
least so that we can use MSI-X.

The problem is that it requires invasive changes in the firmware
interfaces and drivers. They need to describe relationship between IOMMU
and endpoint, and DT or ACPI IORT don't expect the programming interface
to be inside the PCI bus that the IOMMU manages. Describing it as a
peripheral is more natural. For AMD it is implemented in their driver
using IVHD tables that can't be reused. Right now I don't expect any
success in proposing changes to firmware interfaces or drivers, because
the device is new and paravirtualized, and works out of the box with
MMIO. Hopefully that will change in the future, perhaps when someone
supports DT for AMD IOMMU (they do describe bindings at the end of the
spec, but I don't think it can work in Linux with the existing
infrastructure)

Another reason to keep the MMIO transport option is that one
virtio-iommu can manage DMA from endpoints on multiple PCI domains at
the same time, as well as platform devices. Some VMMs might want that,
in which case the IOMMU would be a separate platform device.

> Will remove need to bother with dt bindings etc.
That's handled by the firmware drivers and IOMMU layer, there shouldn't
be any special treatment at the virtio layer. In general removal of an
IOMMU needs to be done after removal of all endpoints connected to it,
which should be described using device_link from the driver core. DT or
ACPI is only used to tell drivers where to find resources, and to
describe the DMA topology.

Thanks,
Jean
