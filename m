This one actually works because we know that we're building for a BE guest. But I agree that it's a mess and clearly a very incorrect design decision.

I'd vote for defining virtio v2 that makes everything LE. Maybe we could even have an LE capability with a grace period of phasing out non-LE capable hosts and guests.
