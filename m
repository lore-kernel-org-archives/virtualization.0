Ah, I see.  Then we will need a Xen-specific hack.

Yes.  Adding a feature to say "I am a real PCI device" is possible, but
has other issues (particularly as Michael Tsirkin pointed out, what do
you do if the driver doesn't understand the feature).

We can either patch to make PPC weird or make Xen weird.  I'm on the
fence.

Two questions for Paulo:
1) When QEMU support IOMMU on x86, will the virtio devices behind it
   respect the IOMMU (do they use the right memory access primitives?).

2) Are we really going to be able to exclude virtio devices from using
   the x86 IOMMU in a portable way which will always work?  If it's
   per-bus granularity, will qemu really put them on their own PCI bus
   and get this right?  Or will it sometimes get it wrong and users will
   end up using virtio devices via IOMMU by accident?

If the answers are both "yes", then x86 is going to be able to use
virtio+IOMMU, so PPC looks like the odd one out.  Otherwise it looks
like we're really going to want to stick with the "ignore IOMMU" rule
until (handwave future), and we make an exception for Xen.

Cheers,
Rusty.
