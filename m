Either way, if a driver is going to use this, they would need to adjust the
preprocessor checking (as you pointed out) to include: #ifdef CONFIG_HYPERVISORX_BALLOON
in this file. At which point they might as well rename the exported symbol to be more
generic - and do whatever else they need to do (add extra stuff maybe?).

My point here is that its more of name-space pollution. I've gotten flak on doing
this with drivers - which had very generic sounding names, and it made more sense
to rename them with a proper prefix. You are adding pieces of code for the
benefit of one driver.

But that (getting flak on the namespace) might be because the mailing list where I
had posted had more aggressive reviewers and this one is composed of more mellow folks
who are OK with this. Andrew is the final man - and I am not sure what he
prefers.
