No, that's a separate issue.

memcpy_fromiovec() has nothing to do with networking: that was just the
first user.  Note that crypto/algif_skcipher.c also uses it.  The
obvious answer is to move it into lib/.

OTOH making vhost_scsi depend on CONFIG_NET is breathtakingly lazy.  I
expect better from experienced kernel hackers :(
