I just wanted to say that this patch series provides a means for us to
force the coherent DMA ops for legacy virtio devices on arm64, which in turn
means that we can enable the SMMU with legacy devices in our fastmodel
emulation platform (which is slowly being upgraded to virtio 1.0) without
hanging during boot. Patch below.

So:

Thanks!

Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dma: Override DMA ops for legacy virtio devices

Virtio devices are always cache-coherent, so force use of the coherent
DMA ops for legacy virtio devices where the dma-coherent is known to
be omitted by QEMU for the MMIO transport.
