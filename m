Sorry about the commit message. I will have a more descriptive message in the next
submission.

This patch  moves the file from drivers/staging/hv/ directory to the 
drivers/scsi directory; hence double the length. I saw an email from Greg earlier where
he recommended that the patch we post should not delete/modify the files in the hv
directory. When I submit this next, I will take that approach.

I will implement a mempool based allocation scheme as you have suggested.

Will do.

The restrictions (as they are) are really from the windows host side and for what it is 
worth, I have never seen this code triggered at least for I/O initiated by the file system.

I would love to get rid of the bounce buffer handling code by ensuring that the 
upper level code would never present scatter gather lists that would trigger bounce buffer
handling code. How would I accomplish that.

Will do.

I will try to clean this up. Would you want all the cleanup you have suggested here
done before the code can be moved out of staging or could you take the code and I could 
give you the patches to address the issues listed by you. Once again, thanks for taking the time 
to look at this code.
