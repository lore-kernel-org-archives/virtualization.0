For some reason your mails in this thread only appear in the gmail web UI
and not on the IMAP version of my mailbox (my own and Michael's mails are
fine).

So I'm replying via the web interface, sorry for the inevitable formatting
mess :-/

I've CCd another mailbox in the hopes of getting your mails in that IMAP
folder instead/aswell so I can avoid this next time.

Nothing magic. I've written some logging into my backend and captured the
result for a simple backend initiated connection.

In the log "TX" and "RX" indicate the thread doing the processing (with
"TX" being the one which processes the guest's TX ring, i.e. data coming
from the guest to the host). "<=" indicates a buffer going from guest to
host and "=>" is from host to guest. NB that guest to host replies are
queued synchronously by the TX thread onto the RX ring which is why the
somewhat odd looking "TX: =>" combination can occur. A host initiated
connection also happens from the TX thread in the same way.

The trace is of a simple request response (which both fit in one buffer in
each direction), the lines without an "?X:" prefix are my
annotations/guesses as to what is going on:

TX: =>SRC:00000002.00010002 DST:00000003.00000948
TX:   LEN:00000000 TYPE:0001 OP:1=REQUEST
TX:  FLAGS:00000000 BUF_ALLOC:00008000 FWD_CNT:00000000

TX:  FLAGS:00000000 BUF_ALLOC:00040000 FWD_CNT:00000000

REQUEST + RESPONSE == Channel open successfully

RX: =>SRC:00000002.00010002 DST:00000003.00000948
RX:   LEN:0000005e TYPE:0001 OP:5=RW
RX:  FLAGS:00000000 BUF_ALLOC:00008000 FWD_CNT:00000000

Host sends a request to the guest

TX: <=SRC:00000003.00000948 DST:00000002.00010002
TX:   LEN:00000000 TYPE:0001 OP:6=CREDIT_UPDATE
TX:  FLAGS:00000000 BUF_ALLOC:00040000 FWD_CNT:0000005e

Guest replies with a credit update

TX:   LEN:00000091 TYPE:0001 OP:5=RW
TX:  FLAGS:00000000 BUF_ALLOC:00040000 FWD_CNT:0000005e

Guest replies with the answer to the request

RX: =>SRC:00000002.00010002 DST:00000003.00000948
RX:   LEN:00000000 TYPE:0001 OP:4=SHUTDOWN
RX:  FLAGS:00000002 BUF_ALLOC:00008000 FWD_CNT:00000091

Host has sent its only request, so host app must have done
shutdown(SHUT_WR) I suppose and host therefore sends SHUTDOWN_TX.

TX: <=SRC:00000003.00000948 DST:00000002.00010002
TX:   LEN:00000000 TYPE:0001 OP:4=SHUTDOWN
TX:  FLAGS:00000001 BUF_ALLOC:00040000 FWD_CNT:0000005e

Guest SHUTDOWN_RX. I'm not sure if this is a direct kernel response to the
SHUTDOWN_TX or if the application inside the guest saw an EOF when reading
the socket and did the corresponding shutdown(SHUT_RD).

TX: <=SRC:00000003.00000948 DST:00000002.00010002
TX:   LEN:00000000 TYPE:0001 OP:4=SHUTDOWN
TX:  FLAGS:00000002 BUF_ALLOC:00040000 FWD_CNT:0000005e

Guest SHUTDOWN_TX, I presume that having sent the only response it is going
to it then does shutdown(SHUT_WR).

TX: <=SRC:00000003.00000948 DST:00000002.00010002
TX:   LEN:00000000 TYPE:0001 OP:4=SHUTDOWN
TX:  FLAGS:00000003 BUF_ALLOC:00040000 FWD_CNT:0000005e

Guest shuts down both directions.

Perhaps the guest end is turning shutdown(foo) directly into a vsock
message without or-ing in the current state?

I agree (I hadn't seen this when I replied to Michael similar suggestion).
