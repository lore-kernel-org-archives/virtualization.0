There were two ideas which drove the current design:

1) The Van-Jacobson style "no two writers to same cacheline makes rings
   fast" idea.  Empirically, this doesn't show any winnage.
2) Allowing a generic inter-guest copy mechanism, so we could have
   genuinely untrusted driver domains.  Yet noone ever did this so it's
   hardly a killer feature :(

So if we're going to revisit and drop those requirements, I'd say:

1) Shared device/driver rings like Xen.  Xen uses device-specific ring
   contents, I'd be tempted to stick to our pre-headers, and a 'u64
   addr; u64 len_and_flags; u64 cookie;' generic style.  Then use
   the same ring for responses.  That's a slight space-win, since
   we're 24 bytes vs 26 bytes now.

2) Stick with physically-contiguous rings, but use them of size (2^n)-1.
   Makes the indexing harder, but that -1 lets us stash the indices in
   the first entry and makes the ring a nice 2^n size.

Because the qemu implementation is broken.  We can often put the virtio
header at the head of the packet.  In practice, the qemu implementation
insists the header be a single descriptor.

(At least, it used to, perhaps it has now been fixed.  We need a
VIRTIO_NET_F_I_NOW_CONFORM_TO_THE_DAMN_SPEC_SORRY_I_SUCK bit).

We currently use small rings: the guest can't negotiate so qemu has to
offer a lowest-common-denominator value.  The new virtio-pci layout
fixes this, and lets the guest set the ring size.

Yes, I made some mistakes, but I did steal from them in the first
place...

Cheers,
Rusty.
