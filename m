This isn't Linux-specific though. In general it's somewhere between 
difficult and impossible to pull in an IOMMU underneath a device after 
at device is active, so if any OS wants to use an IOMMU, it's going to 
want to know up-front that it's there and which devices it translates so 
that it can program said IOMMU appropriately *before* potentially 
starting DMA and/or interrupts from the relevant devices. Linux happens 
to do things in that order (either by firmware-driven probe-deferral or 
just perilous initcall ordering) because it is the only reasonable order 
in which to do them. AFAIK the platforms which don't rely on any 
firmware description of their IOMMU tend to have a fairly static system 
architecture (such that the OS simply makes hard-coded assumptions), so 
it's not necessarily entirely clear how they would cope with 
virtio-iommu either way.
