So that is about what I had in mind. We end up having to do something
completely different to support this more complex solution. I think we
might have referred to it as v2/v3 in a different thread, and
virt-bond in this thread.

Basically we need some sort of PCI or PCIe topology mapping for the
devices that can be translated into something we can communicate over
the communication channel. After that we also have the added
complexity of how do we figure out which Tx path we want to choose.
This is one of the reasons why I was thinking of something like a eBPF
blob that is handed up from the host side and into the guest to select
the Tx queue. That way when we add some new approach such as a
NUMA/cpu based netdev selection then we just provide an eBPF blob that
does that. Most of this is just theoretical at this point though since
I haven't had a chance to look into it too deeply yet. If you want to
take something like this on the help would always be welcome.. :)

The other thing I am looking at is trying to find a good way to do
dirty page tracking in the hypervisor using something like a
para-virtual IOMMU. However I don't have any ETA on that as I am just
starting out and have limited development time. If we get that in
place we can leave the VF in the guest until the very last moments
instead of having to remove it before we start the live migration.
