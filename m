Objectively speaking neither solution is hypervisor neutral as there are
hypervisors that implement either VMCI or virtio or something else
entirely.

Our position is that VSOCK feature set is more complete and that it
should be possible to use transports other than VMCI for VSOCK traffic,
should interested parties implement them, and on this basis we ask to
include VSOCK.
