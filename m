That ambiguity should be resolved with this patch.

You would be able to look at the new counters and see that the
allocations were distributed evenly at the time of allocation. If an
imbalance is observed afterward we would know that it was due to
migration.

That was the motivation for v2. In the previous rev, there was debate on
the lack of accounting for the fallback cases. So in this patch we
account for the fallbacks by making use of miss/foreign. In terms of how
the counters are intended to be used, the workflow would resemble:

1) Pressure/OOMs reported while system-wide memory is free.
2) Check /proc/zoneinfo or per-node stats in .../nodeN/vmstat to narrow
    down node(s) under pressure.
3) Check per-policy hit/miss/foreign counters (added by this patch) on
    node(s) to see what policy is driving allocations there (intentional
    vs fallback).
4) Use /proc/*/numa_maps to identify tasks using the policy.
