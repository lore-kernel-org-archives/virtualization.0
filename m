No, I'm using this:

Sure:

My setup is not SMP-based; it's two separate processors running in AMP
configuration. The processors have completely different architectures,
are not cache coherent, and only simply share some memory, which is
used for communications using virtio as the shared memory "wire"
protocol (i.e. we're not even doing virtualization: we have Linux on
one processor, and some RTOS on another processor, and they use virtio
to send and receive buffers).

So it's not SMP effects we're controlling; we're pretty much doing
MMIO and must use mandatory barriers (otherwise we see breakage).

Sorry, unfortunately I have no way to measure this, as I don't have
any virtualization/x86 setup. I'm developing on ARM SoCs, where
virtualization hardware is coming, but not here yet.

> One wonders how the remote side knows enough to set this flag?

The remote side is a dedicated firmware loaded in order to boot the
other processor, so it really is intimate with the platform and its
requirements (and it publishes the virtio device features for every
supported virtio device).

Sorry, as I said, I have no way to do that... Any chance you did some
measurements back then when d57ed95 was introduced ?

I just guessed it did improve performance, otherwise you probably
wouldn't have bothered. But if not, then reverting it is surely
preferable to adding more complexity.

Thanks!
Ohad.
