This patch also have the intermixing issues, I mentioned for patch 2/2.

It is slightly better, as it is consistent in calling XDP-generic in
the XDP_REDIRECT action, which an action under heavy development, here
we want the freedom to develop in different code tempi.  And some
features might never be available in XDP-generic. Thus, when a feature
is missing/broken it will be consistent for the user.

The remaining question is how will a user know that XDP "mode" she is
using?  The user clearly loaded an XDP-native program, and expect the
associated performance, but XDP_REDIRECT will be using the slow
XDP-generic code path...

I think you also need to check the tailroom here? (AFAIK this is hidden
in the len_to_ctx as the "truesize").
