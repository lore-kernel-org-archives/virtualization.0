Because of renames, the network developers really can't review this.  I
suggest posting a new patch, that just adds the driver to the
drivers/net/ directory, and have the network developer review it that
way.

Then, when it is accepted, I can delete the version in the staging
directory.  We've done it this way for other drivers and it is the best
way to get proper reviews as well as handling cross-subsystem merge
issues.

thanks,
