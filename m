Ok, so those are two different users then.

I think I need to read more of the series, but that should be enough
info to get me started :)

An accessor looks more sane than a global variable, yes.

As long as it's not too unreasonable, I think we should keep the
infrastructure for multiple css instances in place.

I disagree. I think there's value in keeping the interfaces clean
(within reasonable bounds, of course.) Even if there is no
implementation of MCSS-E other than QEMU... it is probably a good idea
to spend some brain cycles to make this conceptually clean.
