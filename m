Paul & Peter,

Thanks for looking into this stuff and providing me such valuable feedback, and
RCU usage crashcourse.

I believe rcu_dereference_protected() is what I want/need here, since this code
is always called for pages which we hold locked (PG_locked bit). So, it brings me
to ask you if the following usage looks sane enough to fix the well pointed issue,
or if it's another misuse of RCU API:

+       mapping = rcu_dereference_protecetd(page->mapping, PageLocked(page));
+       if (mapping)
+               mapping = mapping->assoc_mapping;
