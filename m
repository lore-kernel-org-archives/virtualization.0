Hi,

Apologies for the delay, I wanted to get answers together for all of the
open questions raised on this thread. The first patch in this patchset is
already merged, so after the merge window re-opens I'll send out new
patchsets covering the remaining 3 patches.

After reflecting on feedback from this thread, I think it makes sense to
separate out the per-receive queue page frag allocator patches from the
autotuning patch when the merge window re-opens. The per-receive queue
page frag allocator patches help deal with fragmentation (PAGE_SIZE does
not evenly divide MERGE_BUFFER_LEN), and provide benefits whether or not
auto-tuning is present. Auto-tuning can then be evaluated separately.

If multiple streams of very different packet sizes are arriving on the
same receive queue, no single buffer size is ideal(e.g., large buffers
will cause small packets to take up too much memory, but small buffers
may reduce throughput somewhat for large packets). We don't know a
priori which packet will be delivered to a given receive queue packet
buffer, so any size we choose will not be optimal for all cases if we
have significant variance in packet sizes.

Great point, I should have included that in my initial benchmarking. I ran
a benchmark in the same environment as my initial results, this time with
the first 3 patches in this patchset applied but without the autotuning
patch.  The average performance over 5 runs of 30-second netperf was
13760.85Gb/s.

Yes, that is possible if the average packet length decreases.

I agree it may not be 100% accurate but we can choose a weight that will
cause the average packet size to change slowly. Even with an order 3 page
there will not be too many packet buffers allocated from a single page.

That makes sense, I agree a comment is needed. The weight determines
how quickly we react to a change in packet size. As we attempt to fill
all free ring entries on refill (in try_fill_recv), I chose a large
weight so that a short burst of traffic with a different average packet
size will not substantially shift the packet buffer size for the entire
ring the next time try_fill_recv is called. I'll add a comment that
compares 64 to nearby values (32, 16).

Best,

Mike
