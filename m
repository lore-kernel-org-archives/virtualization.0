Yes, sorry for the typo.

Wait, what?  What is a "released kernel"?  We are working on the
in-kernel patch, we don't care about older distros/releases for this
work at all.  Also, it doesn't make sense at all, why would the change I
asked for make any difference on older distros/kernels?

Yes, that is what is needed to be done.

Please do the correct thing and use MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE().
