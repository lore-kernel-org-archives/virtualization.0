This works in the regimen that XDP packets always live in exactly one
page.  That will be needed to mmap the RX ring into userspace, and it
helps make adjust_header trivial as well.

MTU 1500, PAGESIZE >= 4096, so a headroom of 256 is no problem, and
we still have enough tailroom for skb_shared_info should we wrap
the buffer into a real SKB and push it into the stack.

If you are trying to do buffering differently for virtio_net, well...
that's a self inflicted wound as far as I can tell.
