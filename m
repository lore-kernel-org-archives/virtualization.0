Yes.  There's no reason why the management stack couldn't implement its 
own private idiot-proofing network for this kind of thing.

There's nothing wrong with user-mode TCP, or you could run your TCP 
stack in a special-purpose guest if you're really paranoid.

The trouble is that it presumes that the host and guest (or whoever the 
endpoints are) are on the same physical machine and will remain that 
way.  Given that live migration is a feature that people seem to like, 
then you'd end up needing to transport this protocol over a real network 
anyway - and at that point you may as well use proper TCP/IP.   The 
alternative is to say either "if you use this feature you can't migrate, 
and you can only resume on the same host", or "you can use this feature, 
and we'll work out a global namespace and proxy it over TCP for you".  
Neither seems very satisfactory.
