This is not an issue on the Linux side. From what I remember, this was
Guest/Host protocol related. Once I confirmed the second issue, I did 
not pursue this issue further.

In practical terms, I am not sure this is a major problem. If the root device
Is managed by a Hyper-V driver, then you cannot unload that driver and 
drivers it depends on anyway.

On the Xen side, from as long as I can remember, the platform_pci 
has been unlodable (does not define an exit routiune). I don't recall 
what the issues have been.

Many hyper-V modules are un-lodable; it is just the vmbus_driver module 
has this issue. Also, since vmbus_driver happens to be the foundational
driver for most of  the hyper-v drivers,  and since ultimately, we do 
want to handle the root device via hyper-v block driver, vmbus_driver will
become unlodable for other reasons.

Will do.

While I have notified the windows team about this issue, I do not know
If/or when this issue may be fixed. As, I noted earlier, having an exit function
gives the impression that the module is unloadable while it is not - today because
of the issue on the host side. Even if the host side issue is fixed, we may not be 
able to unload the vmbus driver for other dependency related issues.
All I did was get rid of the exit function so there 
would be no confusion as to the state of this module. We could easily add the exit 
function, if and when the host side issues are fixed. Even then, this module may
be unlodable if we are driving the root device with the hyper-v block driver.

Greg, I am open to either approach here: 1) I could drop this patch and restore the 
exit function. 2) I could keep the patch as is, but add additional comments to
capture this discussion. Let me know what you prefer and I will send the remaining 
patch-set with the agreed upon changes.
