Hi MST, Greg-KH & Co,

The following is -v4 of the in-flight TCM vhost fabric driver for-3.6 code.
This series has been rebased into target-pending.git/for-next-merge this
evening, and the changelog over the last days from v3 -> v4 has been:
    
*) Rename vhost_vring_target -> vhost_scsi_target (mst + nab)
*) Use TRANSPORT_IQN_LEN in vhost_scsi_target->vhost_wwpn[] def (nab)
*) Move back to drivers/vhost/, and just use drivers/vhost/Kconfig.tcm (mst)
*) Move TCM_VHOST related ioctl defines from include/linux/vhost.h ->
   drivers/vhost/tcm_vhost.h as requested by MST (nab)
*) Move Kbuild.tcm include back from drivers/staging -> drivers/vhost/, and
   just use 'if STAGING' around 'source drivers/vhost/Kbuild.tcm'

This series uses Greg-KH's last recommendation from the linux-next thread
to just KISS + use the STAGING bit for this driver short of moving wholesale
into drivers/staging/tcm_vhost/.

As mentioned in the same thread, MST would like to see this in staging so we
don't have to commit to a ABI for QEMU userspace just yet.  Can we agree that
the STAGING bit usage here is enough to mark this code as staging for users..? 
Pretty please..?

The reason that -v4 currently avoids a drivers/staging/tcm_vhost/ move is to
prevent the staging tree needing to merge vhost + target-pending/for-next for
tcm_vhost build requirements.  It is easier to merge via target-pending w/ the
necessary ACKs for the drivers/vhost/ bits, but I'm fine with posting a -v5
series ASAP to move this code into drivers/staging/tcm_vhost + let staging
handle the necessary vhost + target merge dependencies.

I'll let the staging folks (Greg-KH..?) decided if they are OK with the
extra tree merges here before nominating them.  ;)

So aside from the 'marked as staging' directory location back <-> forth,
please consider ACK'ing the main bits for an initial merge.

Thank you!
