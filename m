out of the way.  Later on we can start seeing how we can combine
some of these files to be arch generic.

+ * A hypervisor allows multiple Operating Systems to run on a single machine.
+ * To quote David Wheeler: "Any problem in computer science can be solved with
+ * another layer of indirection."
+ *
+ * We keep things simple in two ways.  First, we start with a normal Linux
+ * kernel and insert a module (lg.ko) which allows us to run other Linux
+ * kernels the same way we'd run processes.  We call the first kernel the Host,
+ * and the others the Guests.  The program which sets up and configures Guests
+ * (such as the example in Documentation/lguest/lguest.c) is called the
+ * Launcher.
+ *
+ * Secondly, we only run specially modified Guests, not normal kernels.  When
+ * you set CONFIG_LGUEST to 'y' or 'm', this automatically sets
+ * CONFIG_LGUEST_GUEST=y, which compiles this file into the kernel so it knows
+ * how to be a Guest.  This means that you can use the same kernel you boot
+ * normally (ie. as a Host) as a Guest.
+ *
+ * These Guests know that they cannot do privileged operations, such as disable
+ * interrupts, and that they have to ask the Host to do such things explicitly.
+ * This file consists of all the replacements for such low-level native
+ * hardware operations: these special Guest versions call the Host.
+ *
+ * So how does the kernel know it's a Guest?  The Guest starts at a special
+ * entry point marked with a magic string, which sets up a few things then
+ * calls here.  We replace the native functions in "struct paravirt_ops"
+ * with our Guest versions, then boot like normal. :*/

+ * Page Table Handling.
+ *
+ * Now would be a good time to take a rest and grab a coffee or similarly
+ * relaxing stimulant.  The easy parts are behind us, and the trek gradually
+ * winds uphill from here.
+ *
+ * Quick refresher: memory is divided into "pages" of 4096 bytes each.  The CPU
+ * maps virtual addresses to physical addresses using "page tables".  We could
+ * use one huge index of 1 million entries: each address is 4 bytes, so that's
+ * 1024 pages just to hold the page tables.   But since most virtual addresses
+ * are unused, we use a two level index which saves space.  The CR3 register
+ * contains the physical address of the top level "page directory" page, which
+ * contains physical addresses of up to 1024 second-level pages.  Each of these
+ * second level pages contains up to 1024 physical addresses of actual pages,
+ * or Page Table Entries (PTEs).
+ *
+ * Here's a diagram, where arrows indicate physical addresses:
+ *
+ * CR3 ---> +---------+
+ *	    |  	   --------->+---------+
+ *	    |	      |	     | PADDR1  |
+ *	  Top-level   |	     | PADDR2  |
+ *	  (PMD) page  |	     | 	       |
+ *	    |	      |	   Lower-level |
+ *	    |	      |	   (PTE) page  |
+ *	    |	      |	     |	       |
+ *	      ....    	     	 ....
+ *
+ * So to convert a virtual address to a physical address, we look up the top
+ * level, which points us to the second level, which gives us the physical
+ * address of that page.  If the top level entry was not present, or the second
+ * level entry was not present, then the virtual address is invalid (we
+ * say "the page was not mapped").
+ *
+ * Put another way, a 32-bit virtual address is divided up like so:
+ *
+ *  1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
+ * |<---- 10 bits ---->|<---- 10 bits ---->|<------ 12 bits ------>|
+ *    Index into top     Index into second      Offset within page
+ *  page directory page    pagetable page
+ *
+ * The kernel spends a lot of time changing both the top-level page directory
+ * and lower-level pagetable pages.  The Guest doesn't know physical addresses,
+ * so while it maintains these page tables exactly like normal, it also needs
+ * to keep the Host informed whenever it makes a change: the Host will create

-/*P:010
- * A hypervisor allows multiple Operating Systems to run on a single machine.
- * To quote David Wheeler: "Any problem in computer science can be solved with
- * another layer of indirection."
- *
- * We keep things simple in two ways.  First, we start with a normal Linux
- * kernel and insert a module (lg.ko) which allows us to run other Linux
- * kernels the same way we'd run processes.  We call the first kernel the Host,
- * and the others the Guests.  The program which sets up and configures Guests
- * (such as the example in Documentation/lguest/lguest.c) is called the
- * Launcher.
- *
- * Secondly, we only run specially modified Guests, not normal kernels.  When
- * you set CONFIG_LGUEST to 'y' or 'm', this automatically sets
- * CONFIG_LGUEST_GUEST=y, which compiles this file into the kernel so it knows
- * how to be a Guest.  This means that you can use the same kernel you boot
- * normally (ie. as a Host) as a Guest.
- *
- * These Guests know that they cannot do privileged operations, such as disable
- * interrupts, and that they have to ask the Host to do such things explicitly.
- * This file consists of all the replacements for such low-level native
- * hardware operations: these special Guest versions call the Host.
- *
- * So how does the kernel know it's a Guest?  The Guest starts at a special
- * entry point marked with a magic string, which sets up a few things then
- * calls here.  We replace the native functions in "struct paravirt_ops"
- * with our Guest versions, then boot like normal. :*/

- * Page Table Handling.
- *
- * Now would be a good time to take a rest and grab a coffee or similarly
- * relaxing stimulant.  The easy parts are behind us, and the trek gradually
- * winds uphill from here.
- *
- * Quick refresher: memory is divided into "pages" of 4096 bytes each.  The CPU
- * maps virtual addresses to physical addresses using "page tables".  We could
- * use one huge index of 1 million entries: each address is 4 bytes, so that's
- * 1024 pages just to hold the page tables.   But since most virtual addresses
- * are unused, we use a two level index which saves space.  The CR3 register
- * contains the physical address of the top level "page directory" page, which
- * contains physical addresses of up to 1024 second-level pages.  Each of these
- * second level pages contains up to 1024 physical addresses of actual pages,
- * or Page Table Entries (PTEs).
- *
- * Here's a diagram, where arrows indicate physical addresses:
- *
- * CR3 ---> +---------+
- *	    |  	   --------->+---------+
- *	    |	      |	     | PADDR1  |
- *	  Top-level   |	     | PADDR2  |
- *	  (PMD) page  |	     | 	       |
- *	    |	      |	   Lower-level |
- *	    |	      |	   (PTE) page  |
- *	    |	      |	     |	       |
- *	      ....    	     	 ....
- *
- * So to convert a virtual address to a physical address, we look up the top
- * level, which points us to the second level, which gives us the physical
- * address of that page.  If the top level entry was not present, or the second
- * level entry was not present, then the virtual address is invalid (we
- * say "the page was not mapped").
- *
- * Put another way, a 32-bit virtual address is divided up like so:
- *
- *  1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
- * |<---- 10 bits ---->|<---- 10 bits ---->|<------ 12 bits ------>|
- *    Index into top     Index into second      Offset within page
- *  page directory page    pagetable page
- *
- * The kernel spends a lot of time changing both the top-level page directory
- * and lower-level pagetable pages.  The Guest doesn't know physical addresses,
- * so while it maintains these page tables exactly like normal, it also needs
- * to keep the Host informed whenever it makes a change: the Host will create
- * the real page tables based on the Guests'.

- * Patching (Powerfully Placating Performance Pedants)
- *
- * We have already seen that "struct paravirt_ops" lets us replace simple
- * native instructions with calls to the appropriate back end all throughout
- * the kernel.  This allows the same kernel to run as a Guest and as a native
- * kernel, but it's slow because of all the indirect branches.
- *
- * Remember that David Wheeler quote about "Any problem in computer science can
- * be solved with another layer of indirection"?  The rest of that quote is
- * "... But that usually will create another problem."  This is the first of
- * those problems.
- *
- * Our current solution is to allow the paravirt back end to optionally patch
- * over the indirect calls to replace them with something more efficient.  We
- * patch the four most commonly called functions: disable interrupts, enable
- * interrupts, restore interrupts and save interrupts.  We usually have 10
- * bytes to patch into: the Guest versions of these operations are small enough
- * that we can fit comfortably.

- *   old address

- * The "iret" instruction pops those values off the stack and restores them all

- * So we have to copy eflags from the stack to lguest_data.irq_enabled before
- * we do the "iret".
- *
- * There are two problems with this: firstly, we need to use a register to do
- * the copy and secondly, the whole thing needs to be atomic.  The first
- * problem is easy to solve: push %eax on the stack so we can use it, and then
- * restore it at the end just before the real "iret".
- *
- * The second is harder: copying eflags to lguest_data.irq_enabled will turn
- * interrupts on before we're finished, so we could be interrupted before we
- * return to userspace or wherever.  Our solution to this is to surround the
