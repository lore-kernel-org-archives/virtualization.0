True. so we are here

         non NMI lock(a)
         w->lock = NULL;
         smp_wmb();
         w->want = want;
                                NMI
                          <---------------------
                           NMI lock(b)
                           w->lock = NULL;
                           smp_wmb();
                           w->want = want;
                           smp_wmb();
                           w->lock = lock;
                          ---------------------->
         smp_wmb();
         w->lock = lock;

so how about fixing like this?

again:
         w->lock = NULL;
         smp_wmb();
         w->want = want;
         smp_wmb();
         w->lock = lock;

if (!lock || w->want != want) goto again;

Okay. agree.

Yes, right.
