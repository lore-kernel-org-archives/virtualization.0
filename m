You're assuming that the purpose of using IDR_FREE is to save xb_set_bit
from walking the tree unnecessarily.  It isn't; that's just a happy
side-effect.  Its main purpose is to make xb_find_zero() efficient.  If
we have large ranges of set bits, xb_find_zero() will be able to skip them.

Sure.  Would you like to submit a patch?

The assumption is that the user has done:

	xb_preload(GFP_KERNEL);
	spin_lock(my_lock);
	xb_set_bit(xb, bit);
	spin_unlock(my_lock);
	xb_preload_end();

This is not the world's greatest interface.  Once I have the XArray
finished, we'll be able to ditch the external spinlock and the preload
interface and be able to call:

	xb_set_bit(xb, bit, GFP_KERNEL);

I think you don't understand how the radix tree allocates nodes.  preloading
means that it will be able to access the nodes which were allocated earlier.

I haven't reviewed how virtio-balloon is using the interfaces.
