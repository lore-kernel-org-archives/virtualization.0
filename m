OK; I tried on a few larger machines and I can indeed see it there.

That said; our code doesn't differ that much. I see why you're not doing
too well on the 2 CPU contention. You've got an atomic op too much in
that path. But given you see benefit even with 2 atomic ops (I had mixed
results on that) we can do the pending/waiter thing unconditionally for
NR_CPUS>16k.

I also think I can do your full xchg thing without allowing lock steals.

I'll try and do a full series tomorrow that starts with simple code and
builds on that, doing each optimization one by one.
