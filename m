We have three options, no virtqueue for QP, 1 to 1 or multiplexing. What
would be your vote on that?
I think you are for option #1, right? but in this case there is actually no
use of having a virtio-driver, isn't it?

With virtio it is the time to have a standard, do you agree?

From experience we have with other emulated device the gap is getting lower
as the message size getting higher. So for example with message of size 2M
the emulated device gives close to line rate performances.

Or you may use an enhanced rxe device, which bypass the Ethernet and
perform fast copy, as backend device for the virtio-rdma emulated device.
