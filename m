Well it's a small complication for what I hoped would be a meanignful
performance difference, but more below.

Ah, right

I'll have to come back to that sorry, still conducting some experiments
with map/unmap.

I'd rather avoid introducing a single dma_req per viommu, because I'd
like to move to the iotlb_range_add/iotlb_sync interface as soon as
possible, and the request logic changes a lot when multiple threads are
susceptible to interleave map/unmap requests.

I ran some tests, and adding a kmem_cache (or simply using kmemdup, it
doesn't make a noticeable difference at our scale) reduces netperf
stream/maerts throughput by 1.1%/1.4% (+/- 0.5% over 30 tests). That's
for a virtio-net device (1 tx/rx vq), and with a vfio device the
difference isn't measurable. At this point I'm not fussy about such
small difference, so don't mind simplifying viommu_del_mapping.

Yes I guess mmio.txt would be the best place for this.

Right

Thanks for the review,
