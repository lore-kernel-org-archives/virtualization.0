OK, so I'll queue a patch to do this then?

Just to make sure: the question would be, are smp_xxx barriers ever used
in s390 arch specific code to flush in/out memory accesses for
synchronization with the hypervisor?

I went over s390 arch code and it seems to me the answer is no
(except of course for virtio).

But I also see a lot of weirdness on this architecture.

I found these calls:

arch/s390/include/asm/bitops.h: smp_mb__before_atomic();
arch/s390/include/asm/bitops.h: smp_mb();

Not used in arch specific code so this is likely OK.

arch/s390/kernel/vdso.c:        smp_mb();

	    s390/vdso: use correct memory barrier

	    By definition smp_wmb only orders writes against writes. (Finish all
	    previous writes, and do not start any future write). To protect the
	    vdso init code against early reads on other CPUs, let's use a full
	    smp_mb at the end of vdso init. As right now smp_wmb is implemented
	    as full serialization, this needs no stable backport, but this change
	    will be necessary if we reimplement smp_wmb.

ok from hypervisor point of view, but it's also strange:
1. why isn't this paired with another mb somewhere?
   this seems to violate barrier pairing rules.
2. how does smp_mb protect against early reads on other CPUs?
   It normally does not: it orders reads from this CPU versus writes
   from same CPU. But init code does not appear to read anything.
   Maybe this is some s390 specific trick?

I could not figure out the above commit.


arch/s390/kvm/kvm-s390.c:       smp_mb();

Does not appear to be paired with anything.


arch/s390/lib/spinlock.c:               smp_mb();
arch/s390/lib/spinlock.c:                       smp_mb();

Seems ok, and appears paired properly.
Just to make sure - spinlock is not paravirtualized on s390, is it?

rch/s390/kernel/time.c:        smp_wmb();
arch/s390/kernel/time.c:        smp_wmb();
arch/s390/kernel/time.c:        smp_wmb();
arch/s390/kernel/time.c:        smp_wmb();

It's all around vdso, so I'm guessing userspace is using this,
this is why there's no pairing.

It is whenever host and guest or two guests access memory at
the same time.

The optimization where smp_xxx barriers are compiled out when
CONFIG_SMP is cleared means that two UP guests running
on an SMP host can not use smp_xxx barriers for communication.
