The name is quite generic, but in the context of Linux it has so far
been used for a specific software feature and not as a generic name for
flow steering by hardware (or drivers).  The existing documentation
(Documentation/networking/scaling.txt) states quite clearly that 'RFS'
means that specific software implementation (with optional driver
integration) and configuration interface.

No, I don't think it's sufficient.  We have documentation that says how
to configure 'RFS', and you're proposing to add a very similar feature
called 'RFS' that is configured differently.  No matter how clearly you
distinguish them in new documentation, this will make the old
documentation confusing.
