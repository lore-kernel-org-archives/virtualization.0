I haven't looked into the para-virtualization code in other 
architectures to see if my PV code is equally applicable there. That is 
why I put it under the x86 directory. If other architectures decide to 
use qspinlock with paravirtualization, we may need to pull out some 
common code, if any, back to kernel/locking.

It is the same reason that you made them PV ops in your patch. Even when 
PV is on, the code won't need to call any of the PV ops most of the 
time. So it is just a matter of optimizing the most common case at the 
expense of performance in the rare case that the CPU need to be halt and 
woken up which will be bad performance-wise anyway However, if you think 
they should be regular function pointers, I am fine with that too.

Thank for the suggestion, I will remove that when I need to revise the 
patch.

Will do that.

I did that because in all the architectures except s390, the lock 
functions are not inlined. They live in the _raw_spin_lock* defined in 
kernel/locking/spinlock.c. The unlock functions, on the other hand, are 
all inlined except when PV spinlock is enabled. So adding a check for 
the jump label won't change any of the status quo.

Will do that.

As said in my previous emails, the PV ops call site patching code 
doesn't work well with locking. First of all, the native_patch() 
function was called even in a KVM PV guest. Some unlock calls happened 
before the paravirt_spinlocks_enabled jump label was set up. It occurs 
to me that call site patching is done the first time the call site is 
used. At least for those early unlock calls, there is no way to figure 
out if it should use the native fast path or the PV slow path. The only 
possible workaround that I can think of is to use a variable (if 
available) that signal the end of the bootup init phase, we can then 
defer the call site patching until the init phase has passed.

This is a rather complicated solution which may not worth the slight 
benefit of a faster unlock call in the native case.

In my patch, the two pv_*() calls above serve as replacements of the 
waiting code. Making them return void and reduce to NOPs will cause what 
Konrad said doing the same operation twice which is not ideal from a 
performance point of view for the PV version. Is putting the pre-PV code 
in the comment help to clarify what the code should be before the PV stuff?
