Hi Michael,
I re-ran the tests, this time with the  "turbo mode" and  "C-states" 
features off.
No Polling:
1 VM running netperf (msg size 64B): 1107 Mbits/sec
 Polling:
1 VM running netperf (msg size 64B): 1572 Mbits/sec








As you can see from the new results, the numbers are lower, 
but relatively (polling on/off) there's no change.
Thank you,
Razya
