From the guest driver POV, that is OK because either there is no IOMMU
to program (the current situation with qemu), there can be one that
doesn't need it (the current situation with qemu and iommu=on) or there
is (Xen) or will be (future qemu) one that requires it.

BTW, I once tried to describe the current situation on QEMU x86 with
IOMMU enabled via ACPI. While you can easily add IOMMU device exceptions
to the static tables, the fun starts when considering device hotplug for
virtio. Unless I missed some trick, ACPI doesn't seem like being
designed for that level of flexibility.

You would have to reserve a complete PCI bus, declare that one as not
being IOMMU-governed, and then only add new virtio devices to that bus.
Possible, but a lot of restrictions that existing management software
would have to be aware of as well.
