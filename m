I couldn't agree more.  That doesn't mean I don't think this isn't 
valuable though.

Each of these sockets are going to be connected to a backend (to 
implement guest<=>copy/paste for instance).  We want to implement those 
backends in userspace and preferably in QEMU.

Using some raw protocol over ethernet means you don't have reliability.  
If you use a protocol to get reliability (like TCP), you now have to 
implement a full TCP/IP stack in userspace or get the host kernel 
involved.  I'd rather not get the host kernel involved from a security 
perspective.

An inherently reliable socket transport solves the above problem while 
keeping things simple.  Note, this is not a new concept.  There is 
already an AF_IUCV for s390.  VMware is also developing an AF_VMCI 
socket family.
