Cool.

I'm thinking of the level interrupts here.  You cannot make a change in
the guest, and have it do completely unrelated changes the hardware that
the guest sees.

I would like to see a breakdown of _where_ the 5-15% lies, something
like http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Virtio/Block/Latency.

Staging would be fine by me for both vhost-blk and vhost-scsi.
