Depends. Spec 1.0 describes the bit and that driver can respond
by reseting the device. You seem to do something else
in this patchset, but as designed in 1.0 it does not seem to need
a feature bit.

Why? Device won't set this unless it's in a bad state. In that case,
setting the bit is harmless even if drivers ignore it.
