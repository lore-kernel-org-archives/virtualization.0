The main issue is that current virtio-mmio only support one interrupt which is shared by
config and queues. Therefore the virtio-mmio driver should read the
"VIRTIO_MMIO_INTERRUPT_STATUS" to get the interrupt reason and check whom this interrupt is to.

If we use vhost-net which uses irqfd to inject interrupt, the vhost-net doesn't update
"VIRTIO_MMIO_INTERRUPT_STATUS", then the guest driver can't read the interrupt reason and
doesn't call a handler to process.

So we can assign a dedicated interrupt line per queue for virtio-mmio and it can work with
irqfd.

Yes, maybe should add a new "interrupt acknowledge" register for backend and frontend to
consult the number of queues.

Theoretically the number of interrupts has no limit, but as the limit of ARM interrupt line,
the number should  be less than ARM interrupt lines. In the real situation, I think, the number
is generally less than 17 (8 pairs of vring interrupts and one config interrupt).

Sorry, I mean ARM with GICv2.

Yes, that's right.

About one interrupt for all queues, it's not a typical case. But just offer
one more choice for users. Users should configure the number of interrupts
according to their situation.

Ah, I think ARM is not only about embedded things. Maybe it could has a wider application
such as micro server. Just my personal opinion.

The approach with a shared memory region is dropped as you can see from the mailing list.

The approach of this patch get a net performance improvement about 30%.
This maybe makes sense to the paltform without MSI support(e.g ARM with GICv2).
