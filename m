Well, it _is_ mysterious.

Did you try to locate the code which failed?  I got lost in macros and
include files, and gave up very very easily.  Stop hiding, Ingo.

I have whatever I pulled from firstfloor over the weekend.  It's in
rc7-mm1.  No, it doesn't use local_save_flags.

That's a doddle.

On test system, boot with

netconsole=4444@<test-system-ip-addr>/eth0,<udp-port-no>@<workstation-ip-addr>/<workstation-mac-addr>

On workstation:

sudo netcat -u -l -p <udp-port-no> | tee -a ~/.log/log-<test-system-hostname>
