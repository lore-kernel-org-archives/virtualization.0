Prior/after to this patch, you were not posting buffers, so if packets
were received on a physical NIC, you were dropping the packets anyway.

It makes no difference at all, adding a cushion might make you feel
better, but its really not worth it.

Under memory stress, it makes better sense to drop a super big GRO
packet (The one needing frag_list extension ...)

It gives a better signal to the sender to reduce its pressure, and gives
opportunity to free more of your memory.
