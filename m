You don't need 2 images. You need only one. The one with the team setup.
That's it. If another netdev with the same mac appears, teamd will
enslave it and run traffic on it. If not, ok, you'll go only through
virtio_net.

This cb is called whenever mac changes, but also when netdev appears
(hwaddr changes from 00:00:00:00:00:00 and hwaddr_len from 0)

Sure. As I said, quick and dirty patch :)
