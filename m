It is not me, it is Documentation/memory-barriers.txt from kernel sources.

HW team can't work on voice statements, it should do a work on written 
documents. If that is written (see above the lines which I marked by 
"SYNC_RMB") then anybody should use it and never mind how many 
CPUs/Threads are in play. This examples explicitly requires to insert 
"data dependency barrier" between reading a shared pointer/index and 
using it to fetch a shared data. So, your WRC+addr+addr test is a 
violation of that recommendation.
