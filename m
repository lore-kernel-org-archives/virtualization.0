No one is suggesting that as far as I can tell.

From all that I've gather so far: no you do not want that.  We really
need to figure out virtio "dma" interacts with the host / device.

If you look at the current iommu spec it does talk of physical address
with a little careveout for VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM.

So between that and our discussion in this thread and its previous
iterations I think we need to stick to the current always physical,
bypass system dma ops mode of virtio operation as the default.

We just need to figure out how to deal with devices that deviate
from the default.  One things is that VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM really
should become VIRTIO_F_PLATFORM_DMA to cover the cases of non-iommu
dma tweaks (offsets, cache flushing), which seems well in spirit of
the original design.  The other issue is VIRTIO_F_IO_BARRIER
which is very vaguely defined, and which needs a better definition.
And last but not least we'll need some text explaining the challenges
of hardware devices - I think VIRTIO_F_PLATFORM_DMA + VIRTIO_F_IO_BARRIER
is what would basically cover them, but a good description including
an explanation of why these matter.
