Why ? at writing, it's will be overwriten soon, IIUC. Then, this information
is misleading. plz add a hook like this when it means something. In this case,
read/write callers.
IMO, you just increase patch's readbility but decrease easiness of maintaince.

No. swap-out is caused by a thread who requests memory even while memory is
in short. IMHO, I/O by memory reqraim should work in priority of memory requester.

Consider following situation.

- A process "A" has big memory. When several threads requests memory, all 
  of them are caught by a blockio cgroup of "A".
- A process "B" has read big file caches. When several threads requests memory, 
  all  of them are caught by a blockio cgroup of "B".

If "A" and "B" 's threshold is small, you'll see big slow down.
But it's not _planned_ behavior in many cases.

If you charges agaisnt memory owner, the admin has to set _big_ priority of I/O
controller to "A" and "B" if it uses much memory. I think the admin can't design
his system. It's nonsense to say "plz set I/O limit propotional to memory usage of
your apps even if it never do I/O in usual."


If this blockio cgroup is introduced, people will see *unexpected* very
terrible slow down and the user will see heartbeat warnings/failover by cluster
management software. Please do I/O at the priority of memory reclaiming requester.
