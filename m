There isn't that I know of, so I think it's the best approach we have.

Right but passing virtio through isn't the highest priority on the
radar, but yes, indeed, it should identify them and reject them.

You may well be correct, I remember that we actually created the iommu
infrastructure to a large extent in qemu for ppc/pseries, then it got
extended when q35 came in.

Not yet...

Ok, but do it in a separate patch because it *is* a behaviour change to
some extent.

Ok.
