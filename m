The last sentence is wrong. You have to differentiate between stuff that
is mapped as DMA and that is allocated as DMA. The mapped stuff is
handled via swiotlb and bouncing. But that can not work for vring stuff
which needs to be allocated as DMA.

Consequently wrong. The reason I explained in a reply to Connie (see
there).

I did consider this, the RFC was doing this (again see other mail).

That is a good question I can not answer. Since it is currently at least
a page per queue (because we use dma direct, right Mimu?), I am concerned
about this.

Connie, what is your opinion?
