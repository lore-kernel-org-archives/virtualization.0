The big string name starts with Documentation/ :) There are some discussions 
about changing it to doc/ (or docs/). Also, as you said, kernel-parameters
is already a big name. Perhaps we could use, instead, "kernel-parms".

If we rename kernel-parameters.rst to kernel-parms.rst, plus the doc/ rename,
then the string size will actually reduce:

-		(see Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt), the minimum possible
+		(see doc/admin-guide/kernel-parms.rst), the minimum possible

There are several problems if we keep them at Documentation/ dir:

- We'll end by mixing documents already converted to ReST with documents
  not converted yet;

- A rename is needed anyway, as Sphinx only accepts ReST files that end
  with the extension(s) defined at Documentation/conf.py (currently,
  .rst);

- A partial documentation build is made by sub-directory. If we put
  files under /Documentation, there's no way to build just one
  book.

Do you have a better idea?

My initial patch did that. It created symlinks on the
Documentation/user (with was the previous name for the admin's guide).

The big issue is how to identify what files at Documentation/ that
were not converted yet.

On this patch series, we opted to move the file and keep just a
reference to the most relevant ones, pointing to the new location:
	https://git.linuxtv.org/mchehab/experimental.git/commit/?h=lkml-books-v2&id=217462c76ee1c12b45750723059a3461018b6975
	https://git.linuxtv.org/mchehab/experimental.git/commit/?h=lkml-books-v2&id=d15595a318356804ed1bc42f509e72de9d031513

We could do something similar to Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt.
Yet, the best is, IMHO, to keep this on the absolute minimum of files,
as it also makes harder to identify what txt files still require conversion.

As we have a Documentation/CodingStyle (pointing to the new location),
this should still work. 

That's said, using my maintainer's hat, when I review patches from a newbie,
I actually prefer to point them to some location with the current
practices, as they usually don't know much about the Kernel's way to
receive patch. So, I reply with something like:

	"Please read this:
		https://mchehab.fedorapeople.org/kernel_docs/process/index.html
	 with instructions about how to submit your work"

For an old contributor, I just say: "please follow the coding style" 
or I reply with the output of checkpatch.pl.

Maybe it is just me, but I very much prefer to point to some URL with
everything packed altogether than to do several reviews until someone
RTFM (Read The Fine Manual), and starts to submit it right.

Thanks,
Mauro
