Right, we'll need some quirk to disable balloons  in the guest I
suppose.

Passing something from libvirt is cumbersome because the end user may
not even need to know about secure VMs. There are use cases where the
security is a contract down to some special application running inside
the secure VM, the sysadmin knows nothing about.

Also there's repercussions all the way to admin tools, web UIs etc...
so it's fairly wide ranging.

So as long as we only need to quirk a couple of devices, it's much
better contained that way.

We probably will have to tell qemu eventually for migration, as we'll
need some kind of key exchange phase etc... to deal with the crypto
aspects (the actual page copy is sorted via encrypting the secure pages
back to normal pages in qemu, but we'll need extra metadata).

It's not just a limit mind you. It's a range, at least if we allocate
just a single pool of insecure pages. swiotlb feels like a better
option for us.

It only needs to care at runtime. The problem isn't changing libvirt
per-se, I don't have a problem with that. The problem is that it means
creating two categories of machines "secure" and "non-secure", which is
end-user visible, and thus has to be escalated to all the various
management stacks, UIs, etc... out there.

In addition, there are some cases where the individual creating the VMs
may not have any idea that they are secure.

But yes, if we have to, we'll do it. However, so far, we don't think
it's a great idea.

Cheers,
Ben.
