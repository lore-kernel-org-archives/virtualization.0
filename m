Do you mean reserving the vectors even before we probed the device for
MSI-X support? Wouldn't we need 3 vectors then? (config, input, output).

Just noticed that only virtio-blk uses virtio_config_val(), while the
others are still doing 'if(virtio_has_feature()) vdev->config->get()',
I'll send patches to fix that regardless of what we end up doing here.

Did you want to pass the vq array to virtio_config_val() just to check
that they were already found?
