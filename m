Well, there is some formatting overhead ...

If the pool size is limited, the waste is limited too, so maybe
we are OK with that...

With the limited polling patches, the vq stays full all of
the time, we only poll enough to create space for the new
descriptor.
It's not a must to make them work as they are not upstream,
but worth considering.

Try using memory as a backing store.

Yes but request size might be > 16.
