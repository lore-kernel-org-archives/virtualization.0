Maybe, but we don't need gratuitous changes either, especially if they
break userspace.

How should existing userspace know which ones to skip and which one is
the master?  Right now userspace seems to assume whatever does not have
IFF_SLAVE should be looked at. Are you saying that's not the right thing
to do and userspace should be fixed? What should userspace do in
your opinion that will be forward compatible with future kernels?

Could you give some examples please?

Other masters are setup from userspace, this one is set up automatically
by kernel. So the bar is higher, we need an interface that existing
userspace knows about.  We can't just say "oh if userspace set this up
it should know to skip lowerdevs".

Otherwise multiple interfaces with same mac tend to confuse userspace.
