It doesn't need to, it can work just as well with the existing device.

(I knew you would say that. :)  The feature has been checked elsewhere,
and this code will be unreachable if the feature was not there in the
first place).

Such old configurations do not exist, so it's fine.

I don't understand how that's relevant.  All features that just say
"this field is there in the configuration at that offset" need no ack
from guest, yet they're expressed as "positive" features.

I'm not entirely sure that you understand why migration is broken and
why it is only broken for this particular feature bit (and in a more
benign way for VIRTIO_BLK_F_RO).

Well, I am also looking at how it is used:

static unsigned int features[] = {
        VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST,
        VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_STATS_VQ,
};

        /*
         * Note that if
         * virtio_has_feature(vdev, VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST);
         * is true, we *have* to do it in this order
         */
        tell_host(vb, vb->deflate_vq);
        release_pages_by_pfn(vb->pfns, vb->num_pfns);

So no, it is not used with virtio_has_feature in any way that matters.

Yes, reserving the bit is necessary.

Because the problem is clear, and easily solved, and I don't like time
bombs.

Migration of VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST would be broken, but
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST does not exist and will not exist in the
hypervisor, so it will not be broken.
