Well, the simplest thing is to let the host TCP stack do TCP.  Could you 
go into more detail about why you'd want to avoid that?

Copy/paste seems like a particularly bogus example.  Surely this isn't a 
sensible way to implement it?

I think a socket is a pretty poor choice.  It's too low level, and it 
only really makes sense for streaming data, not for data storage 
(name/value pairs).  It means that everyone ends up making up their own 
serializations.  A filesystem view with notifications seems to be a 
better match for the use-cases you mention (aside from cut/paste), with 
a single well-defined way to serialize onto any given channel.  Each 
"file" may well have an application-specific content, but in general 
that's going to be something pretty simple.

I'm not sure what you're referring to here.
