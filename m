+1 for mst here.

I think that type of sentiment deserves a toast at KS/LC in August.  ;)

So I imagine that setting inquiry/vpd/mode via configfs attribs to match
whatever the guest wants to see (or expects to see) can be enabled
via /sys/kernel/config/target/core/$HBA/$DEV/[wwn,attrib]/ easily to
whatever is required.

However, beyond basic SCSI WWN related bits, I would avoid trying to
match complex SCSI target state between the in-kernel patch and QEMU
SCSI.  We've had this topic come up numerous times over the nears for
other fabric modules (namely iscsi-target) and usually it end's up with
a long email thread re-hashing history of failures until Linus starts
yelling at the person who is pushing complex kernel <-> user split.

The part where I start to get nervous is where you get into the cluster
+ multipath features.  We have methods in TCM core that rebuild the
exact state of this bits based upon external file metadata, based upon
the running configfs layout.  This is used by physical node failover +
re-takeover to ensure the SCSI client sees exactly the same SCSI state.

Trying to propagate up this type of complexity is where I think you go
overboard.  KISS and let's let fabric independent configfs (leaning on
vfs) do the hard work for tracking these types of SCSI relationships.

I really need to learn more about how QEMU Live migration works wrt to
storage before saying how this may (or may not) work.

We certainly have no problems doing physical machine failover with
target_core_mod for iscsi-target, and ATM I don't see why the QEMU
userspace process driving the real-time configfs configuration of the
storage fabric would not work..
