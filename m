I could do that do that, but the intermediate step (one driver, not
the other) is somewhat problematic: the backend in dom0 needs both
drivers, and will refuse to complete device initialization unless
they're both present.

Framebuffer: fbif.h xen-fbfront.c
Keyboard/mouse: kbdif.h xen-kbdfront.h

I added the config dependency because having one without the other
doesn't make sense, as explained above.

Still want it split into two separate patches?

It's designed that way.  dev->info is initialized so that
xenkbd_remove() does nothing.  Then stuff is stored into dev->info
only when it's sufficiently initialized for xenkbd_remove() to clean
it up.

Yes.  xenkbd_probe() initializes info->kbd and info->ptr to null, and
changes that to the device only after input_register_device()
succeeds.  If something goes wrong between input_allocate_device() and
input_register_device(), xenkbd_probe() frees the device with
input_free_device().  This is how input_register_device() wants to be
used according to its function comment:

    /**
     * input_register_device - register device with input core
     * @dev: device to be registered
     *
     * This function registers device with input core. The device must be
     * allocated with input_allocate_device() and all it's capabilities
     * set up before registering.
     * If function fails the device must be freed with input_free_device().
     * Once device has been successfully registered it can be unregistered
     * with input_unregister_device(); input_free_device() should not be
     * called in this case.
     */

There's another bug here: must not call input_unregister_device() when
the device is still null.  Man, I remember checking cleanup multiple
times when this stuff went into Xen (i.e. quite some time ago), and I
still missed this one.  Going to check cleanup *again*.

Thanks!
