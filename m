Yes, I couldn't see any way to eliminate the possibility of OOO.  The
software queue check in RFS should redirect the flow only when it is new
or has had an idle period, when I hope only a few packets will be
received before we send some kind of response (transport or application
layer ACK).  So I think that OOO is not that likely in practice, but I
don't have the evidence to back that up.

If the filter update latency is high enough that a response can overtake
the filter update, there may be more of a problem.
