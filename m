I think we're missing a level of addressing.  We need the ability to
talk to multiple target ports in order for "list target ports" to make
sense.  Right now there is one implicit target that handles all
commands.  That means there is one fixed I_T Nexus.

If we introduce "list target ports" we also need a way to say "This
CDB is destined for target port #0".  Then it is possible to enumerate
target ports and address targets independently of the LUN field in the
CDB.

I'm pretty sure this is also how SAS and other transports work.  In
their framing they include the target port.

The question is whether we really need to support multiple targets on
a virtio-scsi adapter or not.  If you are selectively mapping LUNs
that the guest may access, then multiple targets are not necessary.
If we want to do pass-through of the entire SCSI bus then we need
multiple targets but I'm not sure if there are other challenges like
dependencies on the transport (Fibre Channel, SAS, etc) which make it
impossible to pass through bus-level access?

Yes.

IIUC the in-kernel target always does remapping.  It passes through
individual LUNs rather than entire targets and you pick LU Numbers to
map to the backing storage (which may or may not be a SCSI
pass-through device).  Nicholas Bellinger can confirm whether this is
correct.
