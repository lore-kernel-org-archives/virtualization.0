What I should have wrote is:

if (old == 0) /* YEEY */
  return;

As that would the same thing as this patch does on the pending bit - that
is if we can on the second compare and exchange set the pending bit (and the
lock) and the lock has been released - we are good.

And it is a quick path.

I forgot to mention - that was the crux of my comments - just change
the slowpath to complex name at that point to better reflect what
it does.
