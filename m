That's likely based on what vSockets uses, which is in turn based on
what the VMCI device exposes (which is what vSockets was originally
built on), so unfortunately it's too late to extend that type.
However, that still allows just under 2^32 VMs per host (there are
three reserved values).

As with the cid, the width of the port type comes from vSockets,
which is what this plugs into.

The cid is present in DGRAM packets and STREAM _control_ packets
(connection handshake, signal read/write and so forth).  I don't
think the intent here is for it to be in STREAM _data_ packets,
but Asias can clarify.

I'm guessing that's also based on the original vSockets/VMCI
implementation, where the NEGOTIATE/OFFER stages are used to
negotiate the underlying transport buffer size (in VMCI, the
queuepair that underlies a STREAM socket).  The virtio
transport can probably use 3.

Thanks!
