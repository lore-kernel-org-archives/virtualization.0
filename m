Vhost-net zerocopy delays completions until the skb is really
sent. Traffic shaping can introduce msec timescale latencies.

The delay may actually be a useful signal. If the guest does not
orphan skbs early, TSQ will throttle the socket causing host
queue build up.

But, if completions are queued in-order, unrelated flows may be
throttled as well. Allowing out of order completions would resolve
this HoL blocking.

It does not address completion latency itself. What I meant was
that in an interrupt-driver model, additional starvation issues,
such as the potential deadlock raised at the start of this thread,
or the timer delay observed before packets were orphaned in
virtio-net in commit b0c39dbdc204, are mitigated.

Specifically, it breaks the potential deadlock where sockets are
blocked waiting for completions (to free up budget in sndbuf, tsq, ..),
yet completion handling is blocked waiting for a new packet to
trigger free_old_xmit_skbs from start_xmit.

Can you elaborate?
