Right, this would be a logical extension in that scenario. I would imagine
that in many scenarios running a VEB also means that you want to use
the advanced ebtables/iptables filtering of the bridge subsystem, but
if all guests trust each other, using macvlan to bridge between them
sounds useful as well, if only for simplicity.

You can of course do that by adding one port of the S-component to
a port of a bridge, and using another port of the S-component to
create macvlan devices, or you could have multiple ports of the
S-component each with a macvlan multiplexor.

Just to make sure I get the chain right, would it look like this?
(adapted from Paul's PDF)

eth0 (external) ---scomponent0 --- vlan2 --- macvlan0 
                 |              |         \- macvlan1
                 |               \-vlan3 --- macvlan2
                 |-scomponent1 --- vlan2 --- br0 --- tap0
                 |                             \ --- tap1
                 |-scomponent2 --- vlan3 --- macvlan3
                 \-scomponent3 ---  ---  --- macvlan4

In this scenario, tap0 and tap1 could communicate over the bridge without
tagging, while any data going out through the S-Component gets tagged
with both a 802.1q Q-Tag and an S-Tag. 

macvlan4 would be a guest that does its own tagging, and the external
switch would need to check the VLAN IDs, but it could communicate with
any other guest by tagging the frames as 2 or 3.

macvlan2 and macvlan3 could communicate with each other and with external
guests in vlan3.

Guests on scomponent1 and scomponent3 could in theory have
subdivisions of the network with macvlan running in the guest
to run containers.

Ok, I see. As I said, the host could easily get access to all frames
on macvlan downstream ports by opening a raw socket on the upstream
port (with some extra work if we want to support this in bridge mode).

If you want the inspection to be done in a guest rather than the host,
the easiest way to achieve that would be to connect that raw socket
to the guest using Or's raw frontend for qemu.
