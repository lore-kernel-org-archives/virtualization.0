Right.

I think a good plan is as follows:

1. add code generating IDs on rx path for virtio,
   and re-enable UFO (4+6).

2. Ben's patch doing similar things for tun/macvtap

3. similarly for packet sockets

above seem appropriate for stable

4. 4+6 split, to make it easier for drivers
   to identify when fragment ID is needed

5. extend vnet header, and add ways to enable it,
   when enabled, use that to pass
   fragment ID for tun/virtio/vhost/macvtap/packet socket

4 is what this patchset does.
