No, I just didn't get there yet.

It will issue a kernel warning but not call unlocked_ioctl,
so you need either a compat_ioctl method or list the numbers
in fs/compat_ioctl.c, which I try to avoid.

Right, that works as well, but may get more complicated once we
try to add zero-copy or other optimizations.
