Do we care about these old versions anymore, now that this is really
"new" code going into the kernel?

Huh?  I don't understand, why aren't the "normal" macros good enough for
you?  What are you doing special from the entire rest of the kernel that
you need to do things differently?

I don't understand, what are you doing here with the numbering?

What do these two comments mean?

Again, what are you doing here?  What are you trying to be compatible
with?

Oh, and all of your ioctls _are_ 32/64bit safe, right?  I didn't check
for that here, sorry, but you have, right?

thanks,
