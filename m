I do agree that the naming isn't great. I didn't use "domain" for various
reasons (it also has a different meanings in ARM) but I keep regretting
it. As there is no virtio-iommu code upstream yet, it is still possible to
change this one.

I find that "address space" was a good fit for the baseline device, but
the name doesn't scale. When introducing PASIDs, the address space moves
one level down in the programming model. It is contexts, anonymous or
PASID-tagged, that should be called address spaces. I was considering
replacing it with "domain", "container", "partition"...

Even though I don't want to use too much Linux terminology (virtio isn't
just Linux), "domain" is better fitted, somewhat neutral, and gets the
point across. A domain has one or more input address spaces and a single
output address space.

When introducing nested translation to virtio-iommu (for the guest to have
virtual machines itself), there will be one or more intermediate address
spaces. Domains will be nested, with the terminology "parent domain" and
"child domain". I only briefly looked at a programming model for this but
I think we can nest virtio-iommus without much hassle.

If there is no objection the next version will use "domain" in place of
"address_space". The change is quite invasive at this point, but I believe
that it will makes things more clear down the road.

I think introducing this explanation when PASIDs are added to the spec is
good enough. Right now it would look like clutter.

Thanks,
