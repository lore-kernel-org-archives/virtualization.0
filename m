Yes, that's fine too.

Almost.  One is "the guest, if really needed, can tell the host of
pages".  If not negotiated, and the host does not support it, the host
must break the guest (e.g. fail to offer any virtqueues).

The other is "the guest, though, would prefer not to do so".  It is
different because the guest can proceed in a fallback mode even if the
host doesn't offer it.

You're interpreting features as something that dictates behavior, but
they're really just advisory.  You could negotiate VIRTIO_BLK_F_TOPOLOGY
and end up never reading the fields; you could negotiate
VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_ANNOUNCE and never send a guest announcement.

Yeah, but no difference from the POV of the driver.

Delaying or avoiding is the same in the end.  The spec says it well: "In
this case, deflation advice is merely a courtesy".

"I can be chatty if you ask me, but I'd rather be silent if you let me".

TELL is a request of the host to the guest; the guest can agree or not.

SILENT is a request of the guest to the host; the host can agree or not.

Yeah, if you want to do it you can.
