From my point of view, a way to record bio_cgroup_id to page_cgroup is quite neat
and nice.

My concern is "bio_cgroup_id". It's provided only for bio_cgroup.
In this summer, I tried to add swap_cgroup_id only for mem+swap controller but
commenters said "please provide "id and lookup" in cgroup layer, it should be useful."
And I agree them. (and postponed it ;)

Could you try "id" in cgroup layer ? How do you think, Paul and others ?

That's my only concern and if I/O controller people decides to live with
this bio tracking infrastracture,
==
   page -> page_cgroup -> bio_cgroup_id
==
I have no objections. And enqueue necessary changes to my queue.

Thanks,
