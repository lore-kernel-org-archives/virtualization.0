I think so.

Yes, we started from his code.  As Aaron reported, on BFQ our change
to the CIC_SEEKY logic has a bad interaction with the hw tag detection
on some workloads, but that problem should be easy to solve (test patch
posted in http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/11/19/100).

Ok, thank you, I'll try to put together and test some patches, and to
post them for discussion in the next few days.
