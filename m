I added the unfair version of lock and trylock as my original version 
isn't a simple test-and-set lock. Now I changed the core part to use the 
simple test-and-set lock. However, I still think that an unfair version 
in the fast path can be helpful to performance when both the unfair lock 
and paravirt spinlock are enabled. In this case, paravirt spinlock code 
will disable the unfair lock code in the slowpath, but still allow the 
unfair version in the fast path to get the best possible performance in 
a virtual guest.

Yes, I could take that out to allow either unfair or paravirt spinlock, 
but not both. I do think that a little bit of unfairness will help in 
the virtual environment.

No, as I said above. I was planning for the coexistence of unfair lock 
in the fast path and paravirt spinlock in the slowpath.

Again, it is due the coexistence of unfair lock in fast path and 
paravirt spinlock in the slowpath.

Yes, I can take out the cpu_relax() here.
