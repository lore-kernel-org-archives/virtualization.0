You should never care about what the value of the kref is, if you are
using it correctly :)

So I really don't want to add this function, as I'm sure people will use
it incorrectly.  You should only care if the reference drops to 0, if
not, then your usage doesn't really fit into the "kref" model, and so,
just use an atomic variable.

I really want to know why it matters for "efficiency" that you know this
number.  How does that help anything, as the number could then go up
later on, and the work you did at a "lower" number is obsolete, right?

thanks,
