I've already tried implementing this feature. Will you take a look
at the thread whose subject is "I/O context inheritance" in
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0804.2/index.html#2857.

This code is not merged with bio-cgroup yet but I believe some of the code
will help you implement what you want.

Through this work, I realized that if you want introduce
per-device-io_context -- each cgroup can have several io_contexts
for several devices -- it is unable to determine which io_context
should be used when read or write I/O is requested because the device
is determined right before the request is passed to the block I/O layer.

I mean a bio is allocated in the VFS while the device which handles
the I/O request is determined in one of the underlying filesystems.
