It was used to disable tx interrupt during start_xmit().

Yes. It does reduce, see the following test results on multiple 
sessions of TCP_RR

Datacopy:
/size/sessions/+-throughput%/+-cpu%/+-per_cpu_throughput%/+-tx_interrupts%/
/1/50/+0.1/+0.7/-0.6/-72.3/
/64/50/+1.7/+1.0/+0.7/-72.2/
/256/50/+0.0/-0.8/+0.9/-72.4/

Zerocopy:
/size/sessions/+-throughput%/+-cpu%/+-per_cpu_throughput%/+-tx_interrupts%/
/1/50/+3.2/-1.3/+4.6/-71.7/
/64/50/+1.9/-0.2/+2.1/-70.8/
/256/50/+4.4/+0.6/+3.9/-84.2/

No obvious changes for stream rx and tx.

We need to try best to avoid any interrupt after this and 
virtqueue_disable_cb() were always need virtqueue_enable_cb() or 
virtqueue_enable_cb_delayed() afterwards. Those two function will check 
the pending used buffers and set a proper used event.

I tested avail->idx + vq.num but not obvious changes in the performance 
compared to just use avail->idx here. So 0xffff probably won't help 
much. Since we call virtqueue_enable_cb() or 
virtqueue_disable_cb_delayed() afterwards, it doesn't matter that 
whether avail->idx or avail->idx - 1 is used.
