Yes.

virtio-scsi supports multiple devices per PCI slot (or even function),
can talk to tapes, has better passthrough support for disks, and does a
bunch of other things that virtio-blk by design doesn't do.  This
applies to both tcm_vhost and virtio-scsi-qemu.

So far, all that virtio-scsi vs. virtio-blk benchmarks say is that more
benchmarking is needed.  Some people see it faster, some people see it
slower.  In some sense, it's consistent with the expectation that the
two should roughly be the same. :)

Processing virtqueues in separate threads, switching the block and SCSI
layer to fine-grained locking, adding some more fast paths.

It's already happening, but it takes a substantial amount of preparatory
work before you can actually see results.
