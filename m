This doesn't matter much, since the only guests that implement an IOMMU
in QEMU are (afaik) PPC and x86, and x86 does not yet promise any kind
of stability.

Yes, for example on x86 it must be passed through the DMAR table.
virtio-pci device must have a separate DRHD for them.  In QEMU, you
could add an "under-iommu" property to PCI bridges, and walk the
hierarchy of bridges to build the DRHDs.
