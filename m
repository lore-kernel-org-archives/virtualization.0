I fixed that one after you dropped it (hmm, double checking: or at least
I thought I had fixed it, but don't see the code right now; will redo then) 
Basically it was just a one liner anyways - always check against all the
stacks that are there.

There was later a weaker form that should have caught most loops, but admittedly
it wasn't 100% bullet-proof with exception stacks.

No initially it was buggy and that caused several of the crashes.

No, it oopsed because it was broken by itself.
Anyways that got fixed quickly.

There definitely was a patch that made it use it. You might have
not merged it though.

So what is your proposed alternative to handle long backtraces? 
You didn't answer that question. Please do, I'm curious about your thoughts
in this area.
