Hi Herbert,

	NO_CSUM because it really doesn't need a checksum.  The
LGUEST_NET_F_NOCSUM is only set for local inter-guest networking.  If
some guest were to route the packets outside the machine, this would be
an issue, though ("don't do that").

Yeah, definitely good future work.  This is far simpler: external-facing
networks don't get marked with the LGUEST_NET_F_NOCSUM but set.

KVM is going to have a paravirt network driver too: it'd be nice to
share code here.

Indeed, that would be a new feature, and is certainly a consideration
for more efficient inter-guest networking.  However, I consider that
somewhat cheating: it's nice to know that 1500 doesn't suck too hard.

Remember, "Features kill puppies!" 8)

Thanks,
Rusty.
