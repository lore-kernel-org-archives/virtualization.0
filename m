I'll try to clarify:

Indeed, the user will not submit new requests,
but users might also not know that there are some old requests
being in progress of being processed by the device.
The driver, currently, waits for that processsing to be complete.
Cancelling that with a reset on a timeout might be a regression,
unless the timeout is very long.

Hope this makes it clear.

To clarify, virtio generally is designed to operate solely
by means of DMA and interrupt, completely avoiding any PCI
reads. This, due to PCI reads being very expensive in virtualized
scenarios.

The extra overhead I refer to is exactly initiating such a read
where there would not be one in normal operation.
