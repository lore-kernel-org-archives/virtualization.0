I am only interested in the currently active information. Why do you
recommend the use of rtnetlink API over the "ip" command. If I am not
mistaken, the ip command uses netlink to get the information.

This is the only information that requires parsing a distro specific configuration file. Do
you have any suggestion on how I may get this information in a distro independent way.

I saw some documentation that claimed that nmcli could be used to accomplish
all that can be done with the GUI interface. I am looking for a portable way
to accomplish configuring an interface. If nmcli can do that, I would use it. With
regards to D-BUS API, I took a cursory look at the APIs. I am still evaluating
my options.
