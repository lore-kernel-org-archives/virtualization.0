I would really like to see some sort of convention for presenting
per-queue statistics through ethtool.  At the moment we have a complete
mess of different formats:

bnx2x:    "[${index}]: ${name}"
be2net:   "${qtype}q${index}: ${name}"
ehea:     "PR${index} ${name}"
mlx4_en:  "${qtype}${index}_${name}"
myri10ge: dummy stat names as headings
niu:      dummy stat names as headings
s2io:     "ring_${index}_${name}"
vmxnet3:  dummy stat names as headings
vxge:     "${name}_${index}"; also dummy stat names as headings

And you're introducing yet another format!

(Additionally some of the drivers are playing games with spaces and tabs
to make ethtool indent the stats the way they like.  Ethtool statistics
are inconsistent enough already without drivers pulling that sort of
crap.

I'm inclined to make ethtool start stripping whitespace from stat names,
and *if* people can agree on a common format for per-queue statistic
names then I'll indent them *consistently*.  Also, I would make such
stats optional, so you don't get hundreds of lines of crap by default.)

Ben.
