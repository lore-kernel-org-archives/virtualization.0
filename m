Yep, at least that is my preference.

Sounds feasible, I'd like to see the cgroups approach get more traction.
My primary concern is just that I don't want to merge it into specific
IO schedulers. As you mention, we can hook into the may queue logic for
that subset of the problem, that avoids touching the io scheduler. If we
can get this supported 'generically', then I'd be happy to help out.
