But would there be any users of this outside the virtio subsystem?
If no, maybe virtio core is a logical place to keep this.

I don't have a problem with extending DMA API to address
more usecases.

Well for virtio they don't ATM. And 1:1 mapping makes perfect sense
for the wast majority of users, so I can't switch them over
until the DMA API actually addresses all existing usecases.
