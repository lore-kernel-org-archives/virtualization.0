I thought Jason patch was about this, no ?

How is it different with NIC processing in RX path ?

Really, under ATOMIC context, there is no way you can avoid dropping
packets if you cannot allocate memory. If you cannot allocate sk_buff
(256 bytes !!), you wont be able to allocate the 1500+ bytes to hold the
payload of next packets anyway. 

Same problem on a real NIC.

Under memory pressure we _do_ packet drops.
Nobody really complained.

Sure, you can add yet another cache of pre-allocated skbs and pay the
price of managing yet another cache layer, but still need to trop
packets under stress.

Pre-allocating skb on real NIC has a performance cost, because we clear
sk_buff way ahead of time. By the time skb is finally received, cpu has
to bring back into its cache memory cache lines.
