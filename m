x86 has no hypervisor support, and I'd like to understand the desired
semantics first, so I don't think it should block this series.  In
particular, there are at least the following choices:

1) exit to userspace (5-10.000 clock cycles best case) counts as
lock holder preemption

2) any time the vCPU thread not running counts as lock holder
preemption

To implement the latter you'd need a hypercall or MSR (at least as
a slow path), because the KVM preempt notifier is only active
during the KVM_RUN ioctl.
