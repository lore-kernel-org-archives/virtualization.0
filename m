I would have prefered to put it:

void vhost_add_used_and_signal(struct vhost_dev *dev,
			       struct vhost_virtqueue *vq,
			       unsigned int head, int len)
{
	vhost_add_used(vq, head, len);
>>>>    smp_mb();
	vhost_signal(dev, vq);
}

Because it looks strange to have a barrier as the 1st instruction of a
function.  And this way it is clearer (at least to me) what we are
protecting.

But on the other hand, we would have to put a comment explainingthat all
users of vhost_signal() have to put that smp_mb() so .....

Perhaps just improving the commet stating that the corresponding barrier
is there?

Good catch.

Later, Juan.
