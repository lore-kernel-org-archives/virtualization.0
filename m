This is taken care of in the host by presenting to the host all LUNs from
a host's NPIV vHBA.  (Libvirt probably would be the one taking care of this,
because QEMU may not have enough permissions).

I'm not sure I understand.

Neither I nor Fam know this stuff very well, but we are trying to do the same
as Hyper-V (and other proprietary hypervisors too).

Is this your old idea of adding a separate target field to commands,
in order to support 64-bit LUNs?  That is separate, and most FC drivers
only default to 16-bit LUNs anyway.

Yes, of course.
