Sorry for not very clear in my previous mail. The current PV code will 
halt the CPUs if the lock isn't acquired in a certain time. When the 
locker holder come back, it will wake up the next CPU in the ticket lock 
queue. With a simple set and test lock, there is no structure to decide 
which one to wake up. So you still need to have some sort of queue to do 
that, you just can't wake up all of them and let them fight for the lock.
