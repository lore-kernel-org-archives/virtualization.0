I dislike having PPC special cased.

In fact, today x86 guests also assume that virtio bypasses IOMMU I
believe. In fact *all* guests do.

I would much prefer if the information as to whether it honors or not
gets passed to the guest somewhat. My preference goes for passing it via
the virtio config space but there were objections that it should be a
bus property (which is tricky to do with PCI and doesn't properly
reflect the fact that in qemu you can mix & match IOMMU-honoring devices
and bypassing-virtio on the same bus).
