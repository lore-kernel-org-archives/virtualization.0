That patch does a whole lot of useless crap. 

When grabbing some random irq from the PIC is not an issue, then
what's the point of this probing, retry loop and the comments about
racing ? What races here? That does not make sense at all.

I don't know why the previous reviewer wanted to have that
dynamic. That just does not make sense to me.

Btw, that whole interrupt handler with two tasklets, one of them
scheduling work is just screaming threaded interrupt handler.

Thanks,
