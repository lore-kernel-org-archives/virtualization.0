Adding a spinlock to the fastpath for a weird case in the slow path is
bad too.

I dislike several things about this patch:
1) You seem to leak memory if you allocate a batch then don't add it all.
2) You have a module parameter, which I guarantee noone else will ever use.
3) You've made three changes at once: allocating outside the lock,
   batching, and replacing the napi lock with a spinlock.
4) You use the skb data for the linked list; use the skb head's list.

Instead, here's how I think it should be done:

1) Split alloc and add, but make alloc return the skb.
2) Make try_fill_recv() only called in the receive path, keep it
   basically the same (no batching).
3) Add a new try_fill_recv_batch() for the workqueue and init paths.
   This should try to allocate max - num, though in practice the
   first alloc would probably kick off reclaim and take forever,
   then by the time it's done, the problem is solved.  Since it's
   reading max and num outside the lock, write this loop carefully!
4) try_fill_recv_batch() should then stop napi and add as many as it
   can, then restart it, then free any remainder.

Cheers,
Rusty.
