Thank you very much for considering my suggestions.

Ah, OK, I see, we keep reading until read returns 0-sized reply and then
we free the buffer... Never mind then.

If you supply .parse() method for your mousevsc_ll_driver structure and
call hid_parse_report() from it then HID core will set the default
driver and call parse at appropriate time.

Note that the users of hid_hw_start() actually are not low level
drivers, such as usbhid or bluetooth hidp, but higher-level drivers,
such as hid-wacom, hid-a4tech, etc. Since your driver is a low-level
driver (a provider so to speak) it should not call hid_hw_start() on its
own but rather wait for the hid code to do it.

Still, I am not a HID expert either so I'll defer to Jiri here.

Thanks.
