Yes I suppose we can do something similar for the ticket and patch in
the right increment. We'd need to restructure the code a bit, but
its not fundamentally impossible.

We could equally apply the head hashing to the current ticket
implementation and avoid the current bitmap iteration.

An astute observation, I had not considered that.

You presume I benchmarked :-) I managed to boot something virt and run
hackbench in it. I wouldn't know a representative virt setup if I ran
into it.

The thing is, we want this qspinlock for real hardware because its
faster and I really want to avoid having to carry two spinlock
implementations -- although I suppose that if we really really have to
we could.
