This doesn't compile:

make[3]: *** No rule to make target `drivers/staging/hv/storvsc_drv.o',
needed by `drivers/staging/hv/hv_storvsc.o'.  Stop.
make[3]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
  LD      drivers/staging/hv/built-in.o
make[2]: *** [drivers/staging/hv] Error 2
make[1]: *** [drivers/staging] Error 2
make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
make: *** [drivers] Error 2

You need to remove the staging Kconfig/Makefile remnants as well.
