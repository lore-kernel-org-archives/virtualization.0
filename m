Yes, I would think so as long as they are used as modules and the
modules are loaded & unloaded with a registration in between. For
built-in, it is not an issue.

A search on lkml yielded a similar fixup patches recently from Johannes
Thumshirn (actually those are using a idr, but both ida and idr use
common logic), see
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/6748601/ for one such patch.

Yeah, I should have written a better last sentence in the first para,
its not clear in the commit description without looking at my cover
letter. The memory leak is seen only when used as module and the module
is removed with atleast one ida allocation.
