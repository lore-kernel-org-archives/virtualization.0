This is similar to VIRTIO's Shared Memory Regions. A problem with this
kind of approach is that guest software that depends on zero-copy,
O_DIRECT, the ability to mmap, etc may break when passing an address
=66rom one device to another device.

For example, a guest userspace application writing to a virtio-blk
device with O_DIRECT can pass any source memory buffer. One VIRTIO
device will be unable to address another VIRTIO device's DMB. This
problem also extends to vhost-user where one back-end cannot access
another back-end's DMB or Shared Memory Regions.

Maybe your use case will never hit this problem because you can rely on
the guest software never to assume zero-copy/O_DIRECT/etc works.
virtiofs hit it with its DAX Shared Memory Regions.

I'm mentioned it in case this is something you want to think about
before deploying this approach.

Connor Kite is working on a different approach for vhost-user memory
isolation here:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20260723-vhost-user-isolated-memory-v1-0=
-6b97c439eb28@gmail.com/T/#t

It involves a bounce buffer at the VMM level. Unmodified vhost-user
back-ends never sees guest RAM. Guest drivers are also unmodified. The
cost of doing this is that the VMM has to intercept kick and call
eventfds in order to copy between the bounce buffer and guest RAM.

I don't see DMB or vhost-user memory isolation as conflicting features.
There can be two ways of solving the same problem with different
trade-offs. I just wanted to share a link to Connor's ongoing work.
