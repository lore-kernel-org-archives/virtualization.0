I would like to know more about why this is desirable.

We used not to support the modes at all, but it turned out
some tools are confused by this: e.g. people would try to
bond virtio with a hardware device, tools would see
a mismatch in speed and features between bonded devices
and get confused.

	    virtio_net: add ethtool support for set and get of settings


as well as the discussion around it
	https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg362111.html


If you think we need to add more hacks like this, a stronger
motivation than "to see consistency" would be needed.
