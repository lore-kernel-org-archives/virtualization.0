Sadly I don't think much documentation was really added as part of the Nick's
commits about feature, even though commit b67067f1176 ("kbuild: allow archs to
select link dead code/data elimination") *does* say this was documented.

Side rant: the whole CONFIG_LTO removal was merged in the same commit without
this having gone in as a separate atomic patch.

Nick can you provide a bit more guidance about how to get this feature going or
tested on an architecture? Or are you just sticking to assuming folks using the
linker / compiler flags will know what to do? *Some* guidance could help.

From my reading of the commit log he only had tested it with with powerpc64le,
each other architecture would have to do work to get as far as even booting.

It would require someone then testing Nick's patches against a working
powerpc setup to ensure we don't regress there.

I bet :)
