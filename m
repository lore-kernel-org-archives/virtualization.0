This is a good change, but the commit message isn't really accurate.  AFAIK, no
one has found any case where this memset() gets optimized out.  And even with
LTO, it would be virtually impossible due to all the synchronization and global
data structures that kfree() uses.  (Remember that this isn't the C standard
function "free()", so the compiler can't assign it any special meaning.)
Not to mention that LTO support isn't actually upstream yet.

I still agree with the change, but it might be helpful if the commit message
were honest that this is really a hardening measure and about properly conveying
the intent.  As-is this sounds like a critical fix, which might confuse people.
