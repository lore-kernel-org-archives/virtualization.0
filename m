Which bugfix is that?

It should not do that, specifically
vhost_net_get_features does:
	features &= ~(1 << VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF);
unconditionally. This was added with:
5751995a20e77cd9d61d00f7390401895fa172a6

I forced mergeable buffers off with -global virtio-net-pci.mrg_rxbuf=off
and it did not seem to help either.

992cc816c433332f2e93db033919a9ddbfcd1da4 or later should work well
AFAIK.

It should be enough to force mergeable buffers to off by qemu command
line: -global virtio-net-pci.mrg_rxbuf=off

Hmm, I don't see the bug.
