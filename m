This isn't all that special - it's pretty common for
IOMMUs to be pci devices. The solution is to have the device on
bus 0. For example, add it with

DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_EARLY
or
DECLARE_PCI_FIXUP_CLASS_EARLY

in e.g.
arch/x86/kernel/quirks.c
or
drivers/pci/quirks.c

You can also use the configuration access capability
if there's need to access the device before its memory is
enabled.

The point is to avoid command line hacks. Devices should be
self describing.
