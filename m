You can (and users already can) just run qemu with sndbuf=3D0. But if y=

Well an application that streams UDP without any throttling
at the application level will break on a physical network, right?
So I am not sure why should one try to make it work on the virtual one.

But let's assume that you do want to throttle the guest
for reasons such as QOS. The proper approach seems
to be to throttle the sender, not have a dummy throttled
receiver "pacing" it. Place the qemu process in the
correct net_cls cgroup, set the class id and apply a rate limit?
