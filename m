I assumed that the time the request spends in the virtio layer is
(somewhat) significant, specially since that this is something that adds
up over time.

Merge count can be useful for several testing scenarios (I'll describe
the reasoning behind this patch below).

I was actually planning on submitting another patch that would add
something similar into virtio-net. My plan was to enable collecting
statistics regarding memory, network and disk usage in a simple manner
without accessing guests.

How can this be used? my vision behind it was automation of kernel
testing and benchmarking.

I created a simple set of scripts that does bisection of kernel issues
(which is a combination of 'git bisect run' scripts and a simple
framework that generates /sbin/init used for testing without having to
touch any guests or images.

The scripts builds a simple image which contains only whats required to
test the kernel, and runs the test kernel and test image to determine
whether we hit a 'git bisect good' or 'git bisect bad' automatically.

I was looking to expand it to allow detection of more than just patches
that break things, but also patches that caused a performance hit in a
specific scenario.
