Below was a partial kernel log with the unlock call site patch code in a 
KVM guest:

[    0.438006] native_patch: patch out pv_queue_unlock!
[    0.438565] native_patch: patch out pv_queue_unlock!
[    0.439006] native_patch: patch out pv_queue_unlock!
[    0.439638] native_patch: patch out pv_queue_unlock!
[    0.440052] native_patch: patch out pv_queue_unlock!
[    0.441006] native_patch: patch out pv_queue_unlock!
[    0.441566] native_patch: patch out pv_queue_unlock!
[    0.442035] ftrace: allocating 24168 entries in 95 pages
[    0.451208] Switched APIC routing to physical flat.
[    0.453202] ..TIMER: vector=0x30 apic1=0 pin1=2 apic2=-1 pin2=-1
[    0.454002] smpboot: CPU0: Intel QEMU Virtual CPU version 1.5.3 (fam: 
06, model: 06, stepping: 03)
[    0.456000] Performance Events: Broken PMU hardware detected, using 
software events only.
[    0.456003] Failed to access perfctr msr (MSR c1 is 0)
[    0.457151] KVM setup paravirtual spinlock
[    0.460039] NMI watchdog: disabled (cpu0): hardware events not enabled

It could be seen that some unlock call sites were patched before the KVM 
setup code set the paravirt_spinlocks_enabled flag.
