Thanks for submitting this, it will make life easier for distro's
that now have to go through extra effort to include out of mainline
support for Vmware.

You did some scrubbing of the macro's to support multiple kernel
versions, but there are still some leftovers.
This code seems to have a lot of "this added in version xxx"
type comments. These are probably not a good idea to include
in the mainline kernel code.
