Well it causes additional problems. We had some cases where it was really
hard to distingush garbage and the true call chain. I can probably dig
out some examples if you want.

With lots of call backs (e.g. common with sysfs) it is also frequently
not obvious how the call chains are supposed to go.

I would have agreed with you in the 2.4 time frame. It was also
always fun to explain this to a newbie with oopses and watch their
face when they secretly think you're crazy ;-) But code is getting
much and more complex unfortunately and I had a few cases where
it was really ugly to sort them out.

I just want an as exact backtrace as possible. I also think
that we can make the unwinder robust enough.

The problem is not one or a few levels of calls. That can be always figured
out from the source. The problem is when you have a double
digit number of them with non obvious (dynamic indirect) dependencies.  Yes it 
can be figured out too, but it is a long and very annoying process
with lots of grepping etc. and even then you sometimes can't be 100% 
sure in some cases. 

It's also a mechanic process that just cries to be done by a machine instead.

If it was only a few that would be great ...
