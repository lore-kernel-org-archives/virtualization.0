1 Merge BFQ into CFQ (Jens and Fabio). I am assuming that this would
result in time slices being scheduled using WF2Q+
2 Do the following to support proportional division:
 a) Expose the per device weight interface to user, instead of calculating
 from priority.
 b) Add support for scheduling bandwidth among a hierarchy of cgroups
(besides threads)
3 Do the following to support the goals of 2 level schedulers:
 a) Limit the request descriptors allocated to each cgroup by adding
 functionality to elv_may_queue()
 b) Add support for putting an absolute limit on IO consumed by a
 cgroup. Such support is provided by Andrea
 Righi's patches too.
 c) Add support (configurable option) to keep track of total disk
time/sectors/count
 consumed at each device, and factor that into scheduling decision
 (more discussion needed here)
6 Incorporate an IO tracking approach which can allow tracking cgroups
for asynchronous reads/writes.
7 Start an offline email thread to keep track of progress on the above
goals.

Jens, what is your opinion everything beyond (1) in the above list?

It would be great if work on (1) and (2)-(7) can happen in parallel so
that we can see "proportional division of IO bandwidth to cgroups" in
tree sooner than later.
