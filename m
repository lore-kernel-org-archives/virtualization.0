You might want to upgrade your version of checkpatch.  As of 3.8-rc2,
this is what I get:

$ ./scripts/checkpatch.pl -f drivers/misc/vmw_vmci/vmci_queue_pair.h
WARNING: Avoid CamelCase: <PPNSet>
#28: FILE: misc/vmw_vmci/vmci_queue_pair.h:28:
+struct PPNSet {

total: 0 errors, 1 warnings, 191 lines checked

drivers/misc/vmw_vmci/vmci_queue_pair.h has style problems, please review.

If any of these errors are false positives, please report
them to the maintainer, see CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
