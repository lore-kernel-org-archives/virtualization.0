It's not clear thats the right solution.  If the VF devices are _only_
going to be used by the guest, then arguably, we don't want to create
pci_devs for them in the host.  (I think it _is_ the right answer, but I
want to make it clear there's multiple opinions on this).

That is one model.  Another model is to provide one driver that can
handle both PF and VF devices.  A third model is to provide, say, a
Windows VF driver and a Xen PF driver and only support Windows-on-Xen.
(This last would probably be an exercise in foot-shooting, but
nevertheless, I've heard it mooted).

Everyone agrees that some support is necessary.  The question is exactly
what it looks like.  I must confess to not having reviewed this latest
patch series yet -- I'm a little burned out on patch review.
