I'll also look at just going ahead with ->init() in the hwrng_register
function itself, that's in line with the spirit of your patch.

However, that may lead to unwelcome problems.  The other approach is
to call rng_get_data() in hwrng_init().

There are some other considerations: I found this problem while
looking at other things: especially that the hwrng core doesn't take a
reference on the driver that's the current_rng.  That has to be
fixed.  If we always call ->init(), we'll have to cleanup and possibly
take a reference.  I'll look at this more closely in a bit.
