A major problem with the queue spinlock patch is its performance at
low contention level (2-4 contending tasks) where it is slower than
the corresponding ticket spinlock code path. The following table shows
the execution time (in ms) of a micro-benchmark where 5M iterations
of the lock/unlock cycles were run on a 10-core Westere-EX CPU with
2 different types loads - standalone (lock and protected data in
different cachelines) and embedded (lock and protected data in the
same cacheline).

		  [Standalone/Embedded]
  # of tasks	Ticket lock	Queue lock	%Change
  ----------	-----------	----------	-------
       1	  135/111	 135/102	  0%/-8%
       2	  732/950	1315/1573	+80%/+66%
       3	 1827/1783	2372/2428	+30%/+36%
       4	 2689/2725	2934/2934	 +9%/+8%
       5	 3736/3748	3658/3652	 -2%/-3%
       6	 4942/4984	4434/4428	-10%/-11%
       7	 6304/6319	5176/5163	-18%/-18%
       8	 7736/7629	5955/5944	-23%/-22%

It can be seen that the performance degradation is particular bad
with 2 and 3 contending tasks. To reduce that performance deficit
at low contention level, a special x86 specific optimized code path
for 2 contending tasks was added. This special code path will only
be activated with less than 16K of configured CPUs because it uses
a byte in the 32-bit lock word to hold a waiting bit for the 2nd
contending tasks instead of queuing the waiting task in the queue.

With the change, the performance data became:

		  [Standalone/Embedded]
  # of tasks	Ticket lock	Queue lock	%Change
  ----------	-----------	----------	-------
       2	  732/950	 523/528	-29%/-44%
       3	 1827/1783	2366/2384	+30%/+34%

The queue spinlock code path is now a bit faster with 2 contending
tasks.  There is also a very slight improvement with 3 contending
tasks.

The performance of the optimized code path can vary depending on which
of the several different code paths is taken. It is also not as fair as
the ticket spinlock and some variations on the execution times of the
2 contending tasks.  Testing with different pairs of cores within the
same CPUs shows an execution time that varies from 400ms to 1194ms.
The ticket spinlock code also shows a variation of 718-1146ms which
is probably due to the CPU topology within a socket.

In a multi-socketed server, the optimized code path also seems to
produce a big performance improvement in cross-node contention traffic
at low contention level. The table below show the performance with
1 contending task per node:

		[Standalone]
  # of nodes	Ticket lock	Queue lock	%Change
  ----------	-----------	----------	-------
       1	   135		 135		  0%
       2	  4452		 528		-88%
       3	 10767		2369		-78%
       4	 20835		2921		-86%

The micro-benchmark was also run on a 4-core Ivy-Bridge PC. The table
below shows the collected performance data:

		  [Standalone/Embedded]
  # of tasks	Ticket lock	Queue lock	%Change
  ----------	-----------	----------	-------
       1	  197/178	  181/150	 -8%/-16%
       2	 1109/928    435-1417/697-2125
       3	 1836/1702  1372-3112/1379-3138
       4	 2717/2429  1842-4158/1846-4170

The performance of the queue lock patch varied from run to run whereas
the performance of the ticket lock was more consistent. The queue
lock figures above were the range of values that were reported.

This optimization can also be easily used by other architectures as
long as they support 8 and 16 bits atomic operations.
