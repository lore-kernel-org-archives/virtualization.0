It would be an interesting idea if we didn't already have the vhost
model where we don't need the userspace bounce.  We already have two
sets of host side ring code in the kernel (vhost and vringh, though
they're being unified).

All an accelerator can offer on the tx side is zero copy and direct
update of the used ring.  On rx userspace could register the buffers and
the accelerator could fill them and update the used ring.  It still
needs to deal with merged buffers, for example.

You avoid the address translation in the kernel, but I'm not convinced
that's a key problem.

Cheers,
Rusty.
