Hi all,

As Fernando said below, I will be glad if I can help you by taking
notes of the mini summit. I would also be glad if someone helps me
take notes.


Tsuruta-san, thank you for summarizing the topics. It looks good!
The only thing I am worrying about is whether we can summarize our
discussions for 5-6 minutes of presentation.

I would be happy if we all have it in mind that we can send our
message to maintainers, including Ted Tso, by sending our summary.
So before starting the discussion, how about taking some time to
talk about which topic we want to include in the summary.


IMHO,
 >>> - The place where IO controller should be implemented
is the most important, basic, topic, and other things should be
summarized so as to explain why we think the place, e.g. block layer,
VFS layer, common layer, is better for implementing io controllers.

It would also be better if we can answer to the comments we have
already received from maintainers, e.g. Andrew, Jens.


Thanks,
Takuya Yoshikawa
