It was my guess to explain - why barriers was not included originally. 
You can check with Ralf, he knows more about that time MIPS Linux code.

I bother with this more than 2 years and I just try to solve that issue 
- in recent CPUs the load after LL/SC synchronization instruction loop 
can get ahead of SC for sure, it was tested.

MIPS Arch starting from R2 requires that. If some CPU can't, it should 
execute a full "SYNC 0" instead, which is a full memory barrier.

Yes, it was a goal for SYNC_ACQUIRE and SYNC_RELEASE.

Caveats:

     - "Full memory barrier" on MIPS means - full barrier for any device 
in coherent domain. In MIPS Tech/Imagination Tech MIPS-based CPU it is 
"for any device connected to CM or IOCU + directly connected memory".

     - It is not applied to instruction fetch. However, I-Cache flushes 
and SYNCI are consistent with that. There is also hazard barrier 
instructions to clear CPU pipeline to some extent - to help with this 
limitation.

I don't think that these caveats prevent a correct Acquire/Release semantic.
