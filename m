Please find some comments/questions below:

2.6.7:1
I do not understand the footnode #6 sentence: 'Without a specific
definition of the ACK requirements for a given property type, it simply
means that the driver read all fields of that property."
2.6.7:2
what if the driver has not provided a big enough buffer and the device
cannot report all supported properties?
2.6.8.2:
Couldn't we use the same terminology as iommu_resv_type in iommu.h?
the negative form is not the easiest to understand for me.
Why F_MSI?
2.6.8.2.1
Multiple overlapping RESV_MEM properties are merged together. Device
requirement? if same types I assume?

what if the device is a physical assigned device. does the device report
the host doorbell or the guest doorbell, may be worth to clarify.

3.1.1 last paragraph
you talk about device ID but this is a terminology only known by ARM I
think. Actually it is introduced later in 3.1.2.

3.1.2
About ACPI integration. Isn't IORT ARM specific? Will other
architectures use that table? In IORT we also have Named Component node
which look pretty the same. Could you elaborate of the difference?
Device Object name: isn't it the path to the LNR0005 in the namespace?

Thanks

Eric
