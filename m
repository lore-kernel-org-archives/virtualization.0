Hi,

An rb-tree per request queue also should be able to give us this
flexibility. Because logic is implemented per request queue, rules can be 
placed at any layer. Either at bottom most layer where requests are
passed to elevator or at higher layer where requests will be passed to 
lower level block devices in the stack. Just that we shall have to do
modifications to some of the higher level dm/md drivers to make use of
queuing cgroup requests and releasing cgroup requests to lower layers.

This scheme should also be independent of any of the IO schedulers. We
might have to do small changes in IO-schedulers to decouple the things
from __make_request() a bit to insert rb-tree in between __make_request()
and IO-scheduler. Otherwise fundamentally, this approach should not
require any major modifications to IO-schedulers.

That's something I wish to avoid. If we can keep it simple by doing
grouping using cgroup and allow one line rules in cgroup it would be nice.

Ok, this is a good point. Because number of struct requests are limited
and they seem to be allocated on first come first serve basis, so if a
cgroup is generating lot of IO, then it might win.

But dm-ioband will face the same issue. Essentially it is also a request
queue and it will have limited number of request descriptors. Have you 
modified the logic somewhere for allocation of request descriptors to the
waiting processes based on their weights? If yes, the logic probably can
be implemented here too.
