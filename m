Done; I got rid of this function

Done; as I had informed you in an earlier mail, in addition to the two header files
you have mentioned, I have also created driver specific header files for block and
network drivers.

Done. You had expressed some concern that this would expose some issue
with the core vmbus driver (which is what I want to concentrate on this 
go around). I have done this for both the block driver and the mouse driver
and I am pretty sure I can do the same with the network driver. I have not 
currently done this for the network driver, since the number of patches I have 
to submit is already very large.

I have already exchanged an email with you on this. To summarize, it
does not look like there is a problem

Mostly done; most of the errors are in the base kernel coming out of
the macro page_to_pfn()

You are right; all accesses were already serialized with a spin lock and the 
Volatile attribute was unnecessary.

Done.

Greg,

I have had so much fun cleaning up these drivers that I lost track of the patch count.
I have addressed all the issues you have raised in addition to some other cleanup
that I was doing since about a week. As I look at the patch-set, I have little over 
200 patches. If it is ok with you, I would like to send them as a single set. Let me know 
what you prefer. I need to circulate these patches internally before I can send them out. 
I should be able to send these out early next week.


Regards,

K. Y
