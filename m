Pleae don't rename virtio disks, it is way too late for that:
virtio block driver was merged around 2007, it is not new by
any measure, and there are many systems out there using
the current naming scheme.

Probably same. Renaming existing devices will break setups.
I think the idea is to avoid using the
legacy naming in new drivers *that will be added from now on*.
