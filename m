I tested it when I wrote it, but just wrote a tester again:

base		len	npages
0               1       1
0xfff           1       1
0x1000          1       1
0               4096    1
0x1             4096    2
0xfff           4096    2
0x1000          4096    1
0xfffff000      4096    1
0xfffff000      4097    4293918722

Since only root can open the tun device, it's currently OK.  The old code
kmalloced and copied: is there some mm-fu reason why pinning userspace memory
is worse?

But I actually think it's OK even for non-root, since these become skbs, which
means they either go into an outgoing device queue or a socket queue which is
accounted for exactly for this reason.

Damn, you had me reworking this until I realized why.  It's not: we're
inside a loop, doing one iovec array element at a time.

To simplify the failure path.  Hmm, I would use release_pages here...

... but I didn't know that existed.  Had to include pagemap.h, and it's not
exported.  It seems to be a useful interface; see patch.

Cheers,
Rusty.

Subject: Export release_pages; nice undo for get_user_pages.

Andrew Morton suggests tun/tap use release_pages, but it's not
exported.  It's not clear to me why this is in swap.c, but it exists
even without CONFIG_SWAP, so that's OK.
