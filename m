We can't guarantee that hypervisor's implementation are 100% correct.

So we still need something like this patch to detect the wrong
dependencies. And the features fixing like this is not something new,
see how net device fix the features through ndo_fix_features().

This is similar to what I did in v1 and v2. Either are ok for me.

I see ,and this kind of check could be added. But we're really safe
since qemu handle such cases and won't advertise any offload feature is
csum is not supported.
