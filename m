1. do we limit it in case there's a loop in the descriptor ring?
2. do we limit it in case there are indirect descriptors?
I guess I missed where we do this could you point this out to me?

> UIO_MAXIOV is a weird choice here.

It's kind of forced by the need to pass the iov on to the linux kernel,
so we know that any guest using more is broken on existing hypervisors.

Ring size is somewhat arbitrary too, isn't it?  A huge ring where we
post lots of short descriptors (e.g. RX buffers) seems like a valid thing to do.

Point being? All users will cast to a pointer.
It seems at first passing in raw pointers is cleaner,
but it turns out in the API we are passing iovs around,
and they are __user anyway.
So using raw pointers here does not buy us anything,
so let's use __user and gain extra static checks at no cost.

Confused. If addresses 0 to 0x1000 map to virtual addresses 0 to 0x1000
and 0x1000 to 0x2000 map to virtual addresses 0x2000 to 0x3000, then
a single descriptor covering 0 to 0x2000 in guest needs two
iov entries. What can getrange do about it?
