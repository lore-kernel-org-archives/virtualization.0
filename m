Hi everyone,

This is dm-ioband version 1.0.0 release.

Dm-ioband is an I/O bandwidth controller implemented as a device-mapper
driver, which gives specified bandwidth to each job running on the same
physical device.

- Can be applied to the kernel 2.6.26-rc2-mm1.
- Changes from 0.0.4 (24th April):
    - Performance tuning
      - A new bandwidth control policy is added. This policy controls
        bandwidth based on the number of I/O sectors instead of the
	number of I/O requests.
	I think it would be useful for some applications such as video
	streaming or when you want to use high-end storages.
       - Control read and write requests separately. So even if a
         write I/O queue in an elevator is full, read I/O requests
	 won't be blocked.
      - More accurate bandwidth control.
    - Code cleanups. Remove the "LINUX_VERSION_CODE" and "inline" stuff.
    - Fix panic on "dmsetup suspend."
