Well, We do requeue from the job itself. So need to be careful with what
we do with indexes here. Bug seemed to happen all the time when qemu was
killed under stress but now I can't reproduce anymore :(
Will try again later.

It is rare - happens on guest reboot typically. I guess I will
switch to regular synchronize_srcu.

Sure. It does seem that avoiding list lock would be pretty hard
in generic code though.
