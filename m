This might work for you but it's fragile, since without
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM hypervisor assumes it gets
GPA's, not DMA addresses.



IOW this looks like another iteration of:

	virtio: Support encrypted memory on powerpc secure guests

which I was under the impression was abandoned as unnecessary.


To summarize, the necessary conditions for a hack along these lines
(using DMA API without VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM) are that we detect that:

  - secure guest mode is enabled - so we know that since we don't share
    most memory regular virtio code won't
    work, even though the buggy hypervisor didn't set VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM
  - DMA API is giving us addresses that are actually also physical
    addresses
  - Hypervisor is buggy and didn't enable VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM
 
I don't see how this patch does this.
