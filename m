Hi Arnd,

Actually, I used the struct device *dev in my first draft, finally, I replaced
it with void *data, because some MSI devices don't have a struct device *dev,
like the existing hpet device, dmar msi device, and OF device, like the ARM consolidator.

Of course, we can make the MSI devices have their own struct device, and register to
device tree, eg, add a class device named MSI_DEV. But I'm not sure whether it is appropriate.

Hmmm, I still use the IRQ number to map the MSIs to IRQ description.
I'm sorry, I don't understand you meaning.
What are the scalability problems you mentioned ?
For device drivers, they always process interrupt in two steps.
If irq is the legacy interrupt, drivers will first
use the irq_of_parse_and_map() or pci_enable_device() to parse and get the IRQ number.
Then drivers will call the request_irq() to register the interrupt handler.
If irq is MSIs, first call pci_enable_msi/x() to get the IRQ number and then call
request_irq() to register interrupt handler.

Maybe this is a huge work, now hundreds drivers use the IRQ number, so maybe we can consider
this in a separate title.

Yes, we can integrate them, and use a generic ops, add a type in hook function to
differentiate them.

There only two functions use the read_msi_msg(), because every msi_desc has
a struct msi_msg, and it caches the msi address and data. I will consider to
retrieve the msg from cached msi_msg, then we can avoid the msi_read_message().
But msi_write_message() maybe necessary, some xxx_set_affinity() functions and
restore functions need the msi_write_message() to rewrite the address and data.

This is a huge change for device drivers, and some device drivers don't know which msi_chip
their MSI irq deliver to. I'm reworking the msi_chip, and try to use msi_chip to eliminate
all arch_msi_xxx() under every arch in kernel. And the important point is how to create the
binding for the MSI device to the target msi_chip.

For PCI device, some arm platform already bound the msi_chip to the pci hostbridge, then all
pci devices under the pci hostbridge deliver their MSI irqs to the target msi_chip.
And other platform create the binding in DTS file, then the MSI device can find their msi_chip
by device_node.
I don't know whether there are other situations, we should provide a generic interface that
every MSI device under every platform can use it to find its msi_chip exactly.
