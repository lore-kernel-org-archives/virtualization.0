Control Groups is just a framework for associating state with
(user-created) groups of processes. So if you have a problem to solve
that involves tracking state for different processes, or applying
different behaviour to groups of processes based on that group's
state, then cgroups may well be an appropriate tool.

In the case you mention (management of new devices) that's already
somewhat covered by the existing device isolation subsystem - you can
create a cgroup that has (or doesn't have) access to particular HW
devices.
