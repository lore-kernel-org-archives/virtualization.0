The 5-patch series to follow this email extends KVM-hypervisor and Linux guest
running on KVM-hypervisor to support pv-ticket spinlocks, based on Xen's 
implementation.

One hypercall is introduced in KVM hypervisor,that allows a vcpu to kick
another vcpu out of halt state.
The blocking of vcpu is done using halt() in (lock_spinning) slowpath.

Note: 1) patch is based on 3.4-rc3 + ticketlock patches in 
	https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/4/19/335 

 [ The patches are targeted for 3.5 window ]

Changes in V6:
- Rebased to 3.4-rc3
- Removed debugfs changes patch which should now be in Xen/linux-next.
  (https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/30/687)
- Removed PV_UNHALT_MSR since currently we don't need guest communication,
  and made pv_unhalt folded to GET_MP_STATE (Marcello, Avi[long back])
- Take jumplabel changes from Ingo/Jason into use (static_key_slow_inc usage)
- Added inline to spinlock_init in non PARAVIRT case
- Move arch specific code to arch/x86 and add stubs to other archs (Marcello)
- Added more comments on pv_unhalt usage etc (Marcello)

Changes in V5:
- rebased to 3.3-rc6
- added PV_UNHALT_MSR that would help in live migration (Avi)
- removed PV_LOCK_KICK vcpu request and pv_unhalt flag (re)added.
- Changed hypercall documentaion (Alex).
- mode_t changed to umode_t in debugfs.
- MSR related documentation added.
- rename PV_LOCK_KICK to PV_UNHALT. 
- host and guest patches not mixed. (Marcelo, Alex)
- kvm_kick_cpu now takes cpu so it can be used by flush_tlb_ipi_other 
   paravirtualization (Nikunj)
- coding style changes in variable declarion etc (Srikar)

Changes in V4:
- reabsed to 3.2.0 pre.
- use APIC ID for kicking the vcpu and use kvm_apic_match_dest for matching (Avi)
- fold vcpu->kicked flag into vcpu->requests (KVM_REQ_PVLOCK_KICK) and related 
  changes for UNHALT path to make pv ticket spinlock migration friendly(Avi, Marcello)
- Added Documentation for CPUID, Hypercall (KVM_HC_KICK_CPU)
  and capabilty (KVM_CAP_PVLOCK_KICK) (Avi)
- Remove unneeded kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_set_mpstate call. (Marcello)
- cumulative variable type changed (int ==> u32) in add_stat (Konrad)
- remove unneeded kvm_guest_init for !CONFIG_KVM_GUEST case

Changes in V3:
- rebased to 3.2-rc1
- use halt() instead of wait for kick hypercall.
- modify kick hyper call to do wakeup halted vcpu.
- hook kvm_spinlock_init to smp_prepare_cpus call (moved the call out of head##.c).
- fix the potential race when zero_stat is read.
- export debugfs_create_32 and add documentation to API.
- use static inline and enum instead of ADDSTAT macro. 
- add  barrier() in after setting kick_vcpu.
- empty static inline function for kvm_spinlock_init.
- combine the patches one and two readuce overhead.
- make KVM_DEBUGFS depends on DEBUGFS.
- include debugfs header unconditionally.

Changes in V2:
- rebased patchesto -rc9
- synchronization related changes based on Jeremy's changes 
 (Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jeremy.fitzhardinge@citrix.com>) pointed by 
 Stephan Diestelhorst <stephan.diestelhorst@amd.com>
- enabling 32 bit guests
- splitted patches into two more chunks

Results:
results for PLE / non PLE machine were posted for V5 patches in
 https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/23/50
 https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/4/5/73

Current series is giving similar results but more formal results will
be posted in next couple of days.
      
Interestingly with current patchset I do not see CPU stalls observed in vanilla.

TODO: 1) remove CONFIG_PARAVIRT_SPINLOCK ?
      2) experiments on further optimization possibilities.
		(discussed in V6 of ticketlock) 
      3) possible debugfs cleanups (combining common code of Xen/KVM)

Let me know if you have any sugestion/comments...
