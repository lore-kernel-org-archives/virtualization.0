I am aware that UDP inherently lacks flow control.

The aspect of flow control that I am interested in is situations where the
guest can create large amounts of work for the host. However, it seems that
in the case of virtio with vhostnet that the CPU utilisation seems to be
almost entirely attributable to the vhost and qemu-system processes.  And
in the case of virtio without vhost net the CPU is used by the qemu-system
process. In both case I assume that I could use a cgroup or something
similar to limit the guests.

Assuming all of that is true then from a resource control problem point of
view, which is mostly what I am concerned about, the problem goes away.
However, I still think that it would be nice to resolve the situation I
described.
