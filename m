One buffer is nicer, yes, but what's controlling access to this buffer?
You use it in multiple functions, and what's to say those functions
can't be called at the same time on different cpus?  So, shouldn't you
either have some locking for access to the buffer, or have a
per-function buffer instead?

And if you have a per-function buffer, again, you might need to control
access to it as the functions could be called multiple times at the same
time, right?

thanks,
