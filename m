You also made changes (compared to the MCS) in that the unlock path is not
spinning waiting for the successor and that the job of passing the lock
is not done in the unlock path either.

Instead all of that is now done in the path of the lock acquirer logic. 

Could you update the comment to say that please?

Thanks.
