Fixed.  The VMCI headers are now gone from the core in af_vsock.*
and vsock_addr.*

Fixed, lsmod now shows that only the transport has a dependency.

Also, it turns out that we do need a dgram_recv(), since our
transport currently enqueues skbs with VMCI DGRAMs in them, which
need to be converted before copying into the user's buffer.  I've
added that too.

Please see latest patchset (sent a few minutes ago), hope it works
for you this time.

Thanks!
