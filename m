If you boot a Xen PV dom0 on QEMU master with -machine q35,iommu=on
and you add a virtio device, dom0 will end up with a PCI device that
does DMA to "machine" addresses.  These addresses are not compatible
with the DMA API (which works with bus addresses), nor are they the
same as physical addresses.

So virtio in current kernels won't work for the same reason they never
work on Xen.  But virtio-pci with my patches won't work either,
because they (or the Xen hypervisor) will try to program the IOMMU
with a non-identity mapping, causing everything to explode.

Hacking up the virtio-pci driver to explicitly ask Xen for machine
addresses might work, but, at the very least, it will be a giant
security hole if anyone binds a virtio device to a domain other than
dom0 (which, again, is kind of the point of having an IOMMU).

By "paravirt" I meant PV, where there's the weird physical/machine
address discrepancy that's visible to the guest.  This is not to say
that Xen PVH wouldn't also be screwed running on QEMU master.
