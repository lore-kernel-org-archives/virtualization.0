Picky, picky :-).

If base were always page aligned, we'd want

    npages = (len + PAGE_SIZE - 1) / PAGE_SIZE;

which is simply rounding len up to the next largest page size. So when
base is not page aligned, increase len by the left-over space at the
beginning, and then do the same calculation as above. (ie, pretend
base is page aligned, and instead count the excess at the beginning as
part of len.)

    npages = ( (base & PAGE_MASK) + len + PAGE_SIZE - 1) / PAGE_SIZE;

As long as len < PAGE_MASK - PAGE_SIZE, we're safe from overflows.

(The above gives a different answer when len=0, but you guard for that.)
