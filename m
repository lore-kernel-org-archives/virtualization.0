It's only used by callbacks of netif_notify_peers(), so rtnl lock have 
already been hold. Add a comment to clarify this?

Sorry for the typos, would double check in the future.

Sure.

How about delay the clearing of VIRTIO_NET_S_ANNOUNCE bit in the 
workqueue and protect the updating with 
spinlock_irqsave()/spinloc_irqrestore()? Then later notification would 
be suppressed if the sending is not completed.

Probably needed.

This problem should be the same as normal suspending/resuming, if user 
want to announce the link they should use arp_notify instead.
