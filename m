First of all Thank you for all the useful discussions. 
I am summarizing here:

- We have to live with the limitation to not support fstrim and 
  mount -o discard options with virtio-pmem as they will evict 
  host page cache pages. We cannot allow this for virtio-pmem
  for security reasons. These filesystem commands will just zero out 
  unused pages currently.

- If alot of space is unused and not freed guest can request host 
  Administrator for truncating the host backing image. 
  We are also planning to support qcow2 sparse image format at 
  host side with virtio-pmem.

- There is no existing solution for Qemu persistent memory 
  emulation with write support currently. This solution provides 
  us the paravartualized way of emulating persistent memory. It 
  does not emulate of ACPI structures instead it just uses VIRTIO 
  for communication between guest & host. It is fast because of its
  asynchronous nature and it works well. This makes use of at guest 
  side libnvdimm API's 
  
- If disk size freeing problem with guest files trim truncate is 
  very important for users, they can still use real hardware which 
  will provide them both (advance disk features & page cache by pass).

Considering all the above reasons I think this feature is useful
from virtualization point of view. As Dave rightly said we should
be careful and I think now we are careful with the security implications
of this device. 

Thanks again for all the inputs.

Best regards,
Pankaj
