The problem with this approach is that for what I'm doing, the packets aren't 
nicely arranged somewhere; they're in random process memory.

I thought about further abusing writev and readv to do multiple packets at 
once.

Yes, the threshold for copy should probably be set around 128 bytes.

The structure is for virtio, I'm just borrowing it for tap because it's 
already there.  We could rename it and move it out to its own header, but if 
so we should do that before 2.6.25 is released.

Thanks!
