We have demonstrated better results at much higher IOP rates with virtio-blk in 
userspace so while these results are nice, there's no reason to believe we can't 
do this in userspace.

Users want something that has lots of features and performs really, really well. 
  They want everything.

Having one device type that is "fast" but has no features and another that is 
"not fast" but has a lot of features forces the user to make a bad choice.  No 
one wins in the end.

virtio-scsi is brand new.  It's not as if we've had any significant time to make 
virtio-scsi-qemu faster.  In fact, tcm_vhost existed before virtio-scsi-qemu did 
if I understand correctly.

There is no theory.  We have proof points with virtio-blk.

But guest/user facing decisions cannot be easily unmade and making the wrong 
technical choices because of premature concerns of "time to market" just result 
in a long term mess.

There is no technical reason why tcm_vhost is going to be faster than doing it 
in userspace.  We can demonstrate this with virtio-blk.  This isn't a 
theoretical argument.

Asking a user to write a helper script is pretty awful...

It's an entirely different emulation path.  It's not a simple packet protocol 
like virtio-net.  It's a complex command protocol where the backend maintains a 
very large amount of state.

Basically, the issue is that the kernel has more complete SCSI emulation that 
QEMU does right now.

There are lots of ways to try to solve this--like try to reuse the kernel code 
in userspace or just improving the userspace code.  If we were able to make the 
two paths identical, then I strongly suspect there'd be no point in having 
tcm_vhost anyway.
