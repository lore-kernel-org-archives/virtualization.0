Ok, I get the misunderstanding.  For the logic to hold, you need a
serialization point after which tgt->req_vq is not changed.  The lock
provides one such serialization point: after you unlock tgt->tgt_lock,
nothing else will change tgt->req_vq until your request completes.

Without the lock, there could always be a thread that is in the "then"
branch but has been scheduled out, and when rescheduled it will change
tgt->req_vq.

Perhaps the confusion comes from the atomic_inc_return, and that was
what my "why is this atomic" wanted to clear.  **tgt->reqs is only
atomic to avoid taking a spinlock in the ISR**.  If you read the code
with the lock, but with tgt->reqs as a regular non-atomic int, it should
be much easier to reason on the code.  I can split the patch if needed.
