That's absolutely not everything this patch does.  You need to split
this into smaller pieces and explain what you're doing and why for each
of them.

Do we really need header guards on this file?

The original intent here was to have a pci_read_base() that called
__pci_read_base() and then did things like translate physical BAR
addresses to virtual ones.  That patch is in the archives somewhere.
We ended up not including that patch because my user found out he could
get the address he wanted from elsewhere.  I'm not sure we want to
remove the __ at this point.

The eventual goal is to fix up the BARs at this point, but there's
several architectures that will break if we do this now.  It's on my
long-term todo list.

What's going on here?  Why are you adding pci_bar_rom?  For the rom we
use pci_bar_mem32.  Take a look at, for example, the MCHBAR in the 965
spec (313053.pdf).  That's something that uses the pci_bar_mem64 type
and definitely wants to use the PCI_ROM_ADDRESS_ENABLE mask.

This looks wrong too.

And you don't even change the type here ... have you tested this code on
a system which has a ROM?

Er, this is rather important.  Why can you just delete it?
