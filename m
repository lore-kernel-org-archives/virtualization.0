Actually, I was thinking the irq handlers would just not mess around 
with eflags on the stack, just call the chip to ack the interrupt and 
re-enable hardware interrupts when they left, since that is free anyway 
with the iret.  Maybe leaving irqs disabled is better.

I wasn't disabling preemption to actually disable preemption.  I was 
just using bh_disable as a global hammer to stop softirqs (thus the irq 
replay tasklet) from running during the normal irq_exit path.  Then, we 
can just use the existing software IRQ replay code, and I think barely 
any new code (queue_irq(), etc) has to be written.
