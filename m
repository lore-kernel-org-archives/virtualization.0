It's orthogonal in general I agree. The only concern is whether we should keep 
extending existing driver API (ie adding more flags like TUN_NO_PI, etc) or go 
straight to the new/better ring based API. I do not have a strong preference 
one way or the other. So I guess I'm saying I'd be ok with Dave taking them 
for 2.6.25, but that API may be obsolete when the ring based thing comes out.

I'll take a look.

Thanx for the pointers.
