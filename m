Sure, I will do. First time user of quilt. :-)

Thinking more about it, probably block/ will be more appropriate place.
I will do that.

No. You don't have to use dm. It will simply work on regular devices. We
shall have to put few lines of code for it to work on devices which don't
make use of standard __make_request() function and provide their own
make_request function. 

Hence for example, I have put that few lines of code so that it can work
with dm device. I shall have to do something similar for md too.

Though, I am not very sure why do I need to do IO control on higher level
devices. Will it be sufficient if we just control only bottom most
physical block devices?

Anyway, this approach should work at any level.

Thanks
Vivek
