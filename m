Dan,
I am trying to understand your concern here:
You will agree with me that the current code does not overflow the 
buffer since the output is limited to MAX bytes and that is how 
big the output buffer is sized. Now, as I pointed out earlier, if the
string to be converted were to fully occupy the MAX bytes or even be
larger than MAX bytes (no buffer overflow here since we limit the
conversion to MAX bytes), we will get a malformed packet that will be
sent to the host since the size field of the message would exceed
the protocol specified size limit. I was merely pointing out that in
this case, I would rather have the host reject the message than send
a truncated Key/Value string (if we were to ever get invalid key or
value strings).

All I am saying if we have an invalid string we will (a) ensure that we don't overflow
the output buffer and (b) we will generate a malformed packet as we should since
the string we are handling is not valid. Furthermore, I am suggesting that it is better
to have a malformed packet in this case than to have

The host here is a windows host and the protocol verification engine there
will reject a mal-formed message. Having said this, what you are 
proposing is reasonable, I will re-send the patches.
