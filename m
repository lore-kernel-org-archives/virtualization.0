Yes, this is good.

Yes, you are right. In fact I was assuming in this case that the PF driver
might have to allocate VF specific resources before a PF <-> VF
communication can be established but this can be done before the VF PCI
device appears, so I was wrong with this. The current API is sufficient
to handle all of this, so I am withdrawing my concern here ;-)

If pci_iov_unregister is accessible for kernel drivers than this is in fact
all we need. Thanks for the clarification.


I think the patchset looks very good.
