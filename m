At least in Linux we don't really work with deadlines; if there =

are issues they need to be fixed even if it takes longer. I don't =

expect the version in .21 to be really usable anyways; it is clearly
still in development.

It shouldn't touch the hypervisor, just the paravirt VMI backend shouldn't =
it?
I assume you could do a very minimal APIC layer that is just enough to =

talk to your softapic and a genapic backend for IPIs.

At least I would welcome anything that shrinks the number of =

paravirt hooks.

I'm just not sure it would be less hooks: you would probably need
functions to start other CPUs at least.
 =

I must admit I also didn't quite get what was the big problem with
hooking apic_read/apic_write.

For the timer you just need to use a own exclusive =

clocksource that never touches PIT.

If you don't enable them they should be already disabled as default =

state, shouldn't they? =


With an own custom clocksource and possible own APIC layer nobody
would ever enable the APICs.

What do you mean with rewrite? It's quite easy to add a new
backend to the generic IRQ code. They aren't a lot of code.

If you used an own APIC layer APIC would never get control at all.

You could probably do a much simpler version, couldn't you? A lot of =

the stuff in apic.c/io_apic.c shouldn't be needed for a clean virtual
interface. But yes it would probably be still a lot of code.

Still (2) is probably best for now, but the other alternatives
are not as ridiculous as you paint them.
