It says that the guest can does csum offload.  It's not advertised in the 
current Linus tree (it got snuck in by Mark after the large-packets patches 
still sitting in my tree).  It should be tho, since the driver can handle it.  
See patch at end.

I'll retest this when I'm back home with my machines.  Perhaps it's something 
to do with the csum issue.

That seems odd; there is a leak in the vringfd interface which I know about, 
but this looks like a GSO packet from the tun device is sticking around 
somehow.

We can handle receiving partial csums, so set the
appropriate feature bit.
