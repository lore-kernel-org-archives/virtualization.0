I think this isn't something that could be solved by adding a lock, unless host waits for the driver's ACK about finishing the update (this is not agreed in the QEMU part discussion).

Actually virtio_balloon has F_IOMMU_PLATFORM disabled, maybe we don't need to worry about that using DMA api case (we only have gpa added to the vq, and having some entries stay in the vq seems fine). For this feature, I think it would not work with F_IOMMU enabled either.

If there is any further need (I couldn't think of a need so far), I think we could consider to let host inject a vq interrupt at some point, and then the driver handler can do the virtqueue_get_buf work.

Best,
Wei
