If you had simply added Intel CPUs to the list of supported P2P
devices, I might have been willing to accept that. However, you added
these two lines:

+	    (hypervisor_is_type(X86_HYPER_VMWARE) ||
+	     hypervisor_is_type(X86_HYPER_MS_HYPERV)))

This makes your case quite different from AMD's. Their check was for
hypervisor, which leaked to VMs. And, yes, AMD does not work reliably
in guest VMs either. For our internal testing, we have carefully curated
hypervisor configurations and test VMs, along with custom patches,
to test P2P reliably.

This is VMware's problem, not the upstream kernel community's. If VMware
considers P2P important and its customers agree, VMware can upgrade.

It is no different from any other kernel feature.
