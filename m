I think it's pretty large, many milliseconds.

But I wonder what do you mean by "work around". Using buffers within
limited time frame sounds like a reasonable requirement to me. Neither
do I see why would using tx interrupts within guest be a work around -
AFAIK windows driver uses tx interrupts.

We don't enable network watchdog on virtio but we could and maybe
should.
