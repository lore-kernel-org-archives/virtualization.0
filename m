We have that option, but I'm a bit reluctant to rely on it, it has its
issues, but it's something we can look into.

And ? I don't see the problem... When running Xen, you don't put the
capability in. They are negociated... Why can't qemu set the capability
accordingly based on whether it's using KVM or Xen ? It's not like we
care about backward compat of ppc on Xen anyway...

I wouldn't make it "ppc only" at this point but yes. Also keep in mind
that we do have ppc cases where we will want to use the iommu (in which
case the capability would be enforced by the other half).
