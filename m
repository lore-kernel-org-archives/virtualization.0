I'm far from being an expert, but what could be very useful for us is to
have a way for the guest to request IOMMU bypass for a device.

From what I understand, the pSeries platform used by POWER guests always
puts devices behind an IOMMU, so at least for current systems a
description of which devices are covered by the IOMMU would always say
"all of them".

There is a device tree binding that can specify devices connected to a
given IOMMU in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iommu/iommu.txt.
I don't believe POWER machines use it though.
