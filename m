And while at it, maybe add some tipps on how to keep patchseries
small... (people have probably more / better suggestions, please):

- 'submit early, submit often' instead of time based submittal (like...
  oh I hacked 24/7 this week and now is friday, let's see how many
  patches I got...)
- Putting controversial stuff at the end (so at least uncontroversial
  stuff can be applied)
- try to split patchseries into stuff that can be applied independent
  of one another. 
- ...
