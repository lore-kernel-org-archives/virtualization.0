So to drill down on this is this a particular problem with type-1
hypervisors?

It seems to me any KVM-like run loop trivially supports a range of
virtio devices by virtue of trapping accesses to the signalling area of
a virtqueue and allowing the VMM to handle the transaction which ever
way it sees fit.

I've not quite understood the way Xen interfaces to QEMU aside from it's
different to everything else. More over it seems the type-1 hypervisors
are more interested in providing better isolation between segments of a
system whereas VIRTIO currently assumes either the VMM or the hypervisor
has full access the full guest address space. I've seen quite a lot of
slides that want to isolate sections of device emulation to separate
processes or even separate guest VMs.
