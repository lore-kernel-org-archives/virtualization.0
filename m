I'm confused. Patching virtio has 0 effect on existing VMs - they
are running old drivers anyway.

Here's the proposal for guest side:

- Add NETIF_F_UFO6_BIT, set in s2io.
- Teach IPv6 to check NETIF_F_UFO6_BIT and not NETIF_F_UFO_BIT.

What is accomplishes is good speed for virtio with UDP over IPv4,
and correct, slower transmission for IPv6.

Of course this does not help old guests but your patch
to which I'm replying doesn't affect old guests either.

Or did I miss something?
