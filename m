AFAICT, the card would have to access guest memory to read it, using
multiple DMA cycles.  That's going to be slow.

We could, but I think this is going to be a more general problem in
future.  x86 is heading down the IOMMU path, and they're likely to
suffer similarly.

True.  If a device needs it though, we're no worse of having a device
which doesn't work if the driver understand the feature than we were
before.

Cheers,
Rusty.
