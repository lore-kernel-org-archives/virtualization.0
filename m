I think the semantics can be slightly different for different architectures
after all it is still a heuristics to improve performance.

FWIW, The s390 implementation uses kvm_arch_vcpu_put/load as trigger
points for (un)setting the CPUSTAT_RUNNING. Strictly speaking an exit to
userspace is not preempted, But as KVM has no control if we are being
scheduled out when in QEMU this is the compromise that seems to work quite
well for the s390 spinlock code (which checks the running state before 
doing a yield hypercall). 
In addition an exit to QEMU is really a rare case.
