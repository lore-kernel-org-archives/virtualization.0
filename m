i stuck this into tip/x86/bitops branch for kicks - and it blew up very 
quickly on 32-bit ;-)

The crash manifests itself as a flood of spurious irqs:

[    0.997179] irq 96, desc: 788ddd80, depth: 1, count: 0, unhandled: 0
[    1.003414] ->handle_irq():  7814c888, handle_bad_irq+0x0/0x1b0
[    1.003414] ->chip(): 78867174, no_irq_chip+0x0/0x40
[    1.008350] ->action(): 00000000
[    1.008350]   IRQ_DISABLED set
[    1.010339] unexpected IRQ trap at vector 60

unappying that change makes the system boot up fine.

a quick guess would be:

   io_apic_32.c:   if (test_and_set_bit(vector, used_vectors))

   io_apic_32.c:           set_bit(i, used_vectors);

Below is the commit, it needed a small amount of massaging to apply the 
void * -> unsigned long * change in the x86/bitops topic.

    x86, bitops: make constant-bit set/clear_bit ops faster

    I dunno. Here's a untested (!!) patch that turns constant-bit
    set/clear_bit ops into byte mask ops (lock orb/andb).
    
    It's not exactly pretty. The reason for using the byte versions is that a
    locked op is serialized in the memory pipeline anyway, so there are no
    forwarding issues (that could slow down things when we access things with
    different sizes), and the byte ops are a lot smaller than 32-bit and
    particularly 64-bit ops (big constants, and the 64-bit ops need the REX
    prefix byte too).
    
    [ Side note: I wonder if we should turn the "test_bit()" C version into a
      "char *" version too.. It could actually help with alias analysis, since
      char pointers can alias anything. So it might be the RightThing(tm) to
      do for multiple reasons. I dunno. It's a separate issue. ]
    
    It does actually shrink the kernel image a bit (a couple of hundred bytes
    on the text segment for my everything-compiled-in image), and while it's
    totally untested the (admittedly few) code generation points I looked at
    seemed sane. And "lock orb" should be noticeably faster than "lock bts".
    
    If somebody wants to play with it, go wild. I didn't do "change_bit()",
    because nobody sane uses that thing anyway. I guarantee nothing. And if it
    breaks, nobody saw me do anything.  You can't prove this email wasn't sent
    by somebody who is good at forging smtp.
    
    This does require a gcc that is recent enough for "__builtin_constant_p()"
    to work in an inline function, but I suspect our kernel requirements are
    already higher than that. And if you do have an old gcc that is supported,
    the worst that would happen is that the optimization doesn't trigger.
