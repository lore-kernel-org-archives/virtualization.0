Thanks Greg. The latest re-send of my hv patches are against the tree:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging-2.6.git
that I picked up on April 22, 2011.  I hope there won't be any issues
this time around.

Are you referring to the fact that in the vmbus_match function,
the current code binds the device specific driver to the
corresponding hv_device structure?

I am pretty sure, I can get rid of this. The way this code was originally
structured, in the vmbus_match() function, you needed to get at the
device specific driver pointer so that we could do the binding between
the hv_device and the correspond device specific driver. The earlier code 
depended on the structure layout to map a pointer to the hv_driver to
the corresponding device specific driver (net, block etc.) To get rid of 
this layout dependency, I introduced an addition field (priv) in the hv_driver.

There is, I suspect sufficient state available to:

(a) Not require the vmbus_match() function to do the binding.
(b) And to get at the device specific driver structure from the generic
       driver structure without having to have an explicit mapping 
       maintained in the   hv_driver structure.

Before, I go ahead and make these changes, Greg, can you confirm
if I have captured your concerns correctly.

I am a little confused here. While I agree with you that perhaps we could
get rid the priv element in the hv_driver structure, what else would you 
want done here.

Once I hear from you, I will work on getting rid of the 
priv pointer from hv_driver structure as well as the code that 
currently does the binding in vmbus_match.
