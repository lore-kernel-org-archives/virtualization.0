No, you really want to do this for 1500 byte packets since it increases the 
effective space in the ring.  Unfortunately, Mark points out that kvm assumes 
the header is standalone: Anthony and I discussed this a while back and 
decided it *wasn't* a good assumption.

Ah, thanks for that.  It's not so much ring entries, as guest memory you're 
trying to save.  That makes much more sense.

Good point.  Could you humor me with a comment to that effect?  Prevents me 
making the same mistake again.

Thanks!
Rusty.
