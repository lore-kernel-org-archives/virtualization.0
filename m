My understanding is that code such as IVT table are well tuned and you
are really 
difficult to pursuade people to replace those privilege resource access
instruction
to use vdso or something equalvalent such as mov GRx=CRy.  For those C
code
previlige resource access, like Isaku mentioned, we need to consider
native too.

Anyway binary patching is just an optimization that X86 used and there
is no 
reason IA64 can't take. At least replacing indirect function with direct
function
call.
