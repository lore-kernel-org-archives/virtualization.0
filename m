OK, that explains the difference.

Either way is fine by me.  The best route for this is to get the staging
update into Linus head, then work on the actual SCSI problems.  I'd like
other SCSI people besides me to review it.

As opposed to bounce buffer code which hasn't been well tested either if
it can't be triggered.

Just to be clear: Setting the minimum I/O size is completely well
tested: it's how we handle 4k sector drives.  What hasn't been tested is
the ability of the *driver* to enforce the minimum using
blk_limits_io_min().  As long at that doesn't get overridden by sd when
it sees a 512b drive, the rest of the block paths (those which actually
enforce the minimum) have all been well tested.
