Yes, I agree that the commit log may look a bit scary. How about the 
following:

The kzfree() function is normally used to clear some sensitive
information, like encryption keys, in the buffer before freeing it back
to the pool. Memset() is currently used for buffer clearing. However
unlikely, there is still a non-zero probability that the compiler may
choose to optimize away the memory clearing especially if LTO is being
used in the future. To make sure that this optimization will never
happen, memzero_explicit(), which is introduced in v3.18, is now used
in kzfree() to future-proof it.

Cheers,
Longman
