Oh, sorry I haven't hosted them on any git tree..

Yes, when this patch is applied, the call to cpu_bringup() after HYPERVISOR_VCPU_off
gets removed. So it will look like this:

    cpu_bringup_and_idle:
     \- cpu_bringup
      |   \-[preempt_disable]
      |
      |- cpu_idle
           \- play_dead [assuming the user offlined the VCPU]
           |     \
           |     +- (xen_play_dead)
           |          \- HYPERVISOR_VCPU_off [so VCPU is dead, once user
           |                                  onlines it starts from here]
           |
           |
           +- preempt_enable_no_reschedule()
           +- schedule()
           \- preempt_enable()


And hence we wouldn't have the preempt imbalance, hence no need for the
extra preempt_enable() in xen_play_dead().

So, basically our problem is this:
The generic smp booting code calls cpu_idle() after setting the cpu in
cpu_online_mask etc, because this call to cpu_idle() is used in every
architecture. But just for xen, that too only in the cpu down path, this
call is omitted - which makes it difficult to convert xen to the generic
smp booting framework.

So I proposed 3 solutions, of which we can choose whichever that doesn't
break stuff and whichever looks the least ugly:

1. Omit the call to cpu_bringup() after HYPERVISOR_VCPU_off (which this
patch does).

2. Or, invoke cpu_bringup_and_idle() after HYPERVISOR_VCPU_off (Jan said
this might not work since we are expected to return). ARM actually does
something like this (it does the complete bringup including idle in the
cpu down path).

3. Or, Just for the sake of Xen, convert the __cpu_post_online() function to
return an int - Xen will return non-zero and do the next steps itself,
also deciding between whether or not to call cpu_idle(). All other archs
will just return 0, and allow the generic smp booting code to continue
on to cpu_idle().

Please let me know your thoughts.
