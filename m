I think that is true but it seems that this will be true for x86 for
QEMU 2.2 unless we make some changes there.
Which we might not have the time for since 2.2 is feature frozen
from tomorrow.
Maybe we should disable the IOMMU in 2.2, this is worth considering.

I thought hard about this, I think we are better off waiting till the
next release: there's a chance QEMU will have IOMMU support for KVM x86
then, and this will make it easier to judge which way does the wind
blow.

It seems that we lose nothing substantial keeping the status quo a bit longer,
but if we make an incompatible change in guests now we might
create nasty compatibility headaches going forward.
