Now that you mention it, maybe it would be best to keep the transitive
and non-transitive separate for the time being anyway.  Just because it
might be possible to deal with does not necessarily mean that we should
be encouraging it.  ;-)

What about the smp_wmb() variant of dmb that orders only stores?

Yes, this is a weird one, and I don't know of any use of it.
