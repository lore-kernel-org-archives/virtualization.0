How do you handle these different cases in Linux?  Do you use Vr pages 
in the pagecache, and then shoot down the pagecache entry if the host 
steals the page?

The Uz access exception presumably just generates a normal oops.

(I should probably make time to read the rest of the series.)

Presumably reads from a Vz page also generate a discard fault?

OK, thanks, that clears things up.  I was assuming that Vr was 
technically writable but that writes could be discarded at any time (ie, 
allowing guests to merrily shoot themselves in the foot ;).  Making it 
forced RO is much more sensible.
