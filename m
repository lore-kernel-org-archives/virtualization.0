It's not by design but it seems to be required for existing drivers to
work, so a historical note would be in place, yes. Spec patch?

Well, it seems that if you process descriptors very slowly guest
driver will get stuck for a while, with or without this patch.
Can you present a convincing argument why batching deflate
descriptors in this way makes sense?

It seems that this all started because the kvm tool didn't
process deflate vq at all. Assuming it gains this processing,
is some other reason left?
