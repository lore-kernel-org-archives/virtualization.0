On x86, yes. Practically any instruction will clobber cc anyway, so it's =

the default.

Although the gcc guys have occasionally been suggesting we should set it =

in our asms.

We should just do this natively. There's been several tests over the years =

saying that it's much more efficient to do sti/cli as a simple store, and =

handling the "oops, we got an interrupt while interrupts were disabled" as =

a special case.

I have this dim memory that ARM has done it that way for a long time =

because it's so expensive to do a "real" cli/sti.

And I think -rt does it for other reasons. It's just more flexible.
