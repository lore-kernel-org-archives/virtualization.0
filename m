I guess it depends on the architecture's protection mechanism and
threat model whether this makes sense.

Failing to start a guest is not that bad IMHO, but crashing a guest
that is running perfectly fine is. I vote for just failing the probe if
preconditions are not met.

I would generally expect a guest warning to stay on the guest side --
especially as the host admin and the guest admin may be different
persons. So having a general way to send an alert to from a guest to
the host is not uninteresting, although we need to be careful to avoid
the guest being able to DOS the host.
