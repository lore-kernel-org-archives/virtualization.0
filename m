Hi Jason,

I understand your busy loop timeout is quite conservative at 50us. Did you try any other values?

Also, did you measure how polling affects many VMs talking to each other (e.g. 20 VMs on each host, perhaps with several vNICs each, transmitting to a corresponding VM/vNIC pair on another host)?


On a complete separate experiment (busy waiting on storage I/O rings on Xen), I have observed that bigger timeouts gave bigger benefits. On the other hand, all cases that contended for CPU were badly hurt with any sort of polling.

The cases that contended for CPU consisted of many VMs generating workload over very fast I/O devices (in that case, several NVMe devices on a single host). And the metric that got affected was aggregate throughput from all VMs.

The solution was to determine whether to poll depending on the host's overall CPU utilisation at that moment. That gave me the best of both worlds as polling made everything faster without slowing down any other metric.

Thanks,
Felipe
