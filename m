The fact  that on a particular transaction the host has not responded within an expected
time interval does not necessarily  mean that the guest code would not be running. There may be 
issues on the host side that may be either transient or permanent that may cause problems like
this. Keep in mind, HyperV is a type 1 hypervisor that would schedule all VMs including the host
and so, guest would get scheduled.

In situations where there is not a reasonable rollback strategy (for
instance in one of the cases, we are granting access to the guest
physical pages to the host) we really have only 2 options:

1) Wait until the host responds. This wait could potentially be unbounded
and in fact this  was the way the code was to begin with. One of the reviewers
had suggested that unbounded wait was to be corrected.
2) Wait for a specific period and if the host does not respond
within a reasonable period, kill the guest since there is no recovery
possible.

I chose option 2, as part of addressing some of the prior review
comments. If the consensus now is to go back to option 1, I am fine with that;
I will send you a patch to rectify this.
