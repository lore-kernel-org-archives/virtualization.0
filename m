Following success in previous years to transfer ideas into code,
we started to prepare RDMA miniconference in LPC 2019, which will
be co-located with Kernel Summit and networking track.

I'm confident that such broad audience of kernel developers
will be good fit for such discussion.

Previous years:
2016: https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-rdma/msg43074.html
2017: https://lwn.net/Articles/734163/
2018: It was so full in audience and intensive that I failed to
summarize it :(
