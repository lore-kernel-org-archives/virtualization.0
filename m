Agreed. In my mind this is something that is controlled by the
pass-thru interface once it is enslaved.

I wasn't saying we do that in all cases. That would be something that
would have to be decided by the pass-thru interface. Ideally the
virtio would provide just enough information to get itself into the
bond and I see this being the mechanism for it to do so. From there
the complexity mostly lies in the pass-thru interface to configure the
correct transmit modes if for example you have multiple pass-thru
interfaces or a more complex traffic setup due to things like
SwitchDev.

In my mind we go the bonding route and there are few use cases for all
of this. First is the backup case that is being addressed here. That
becomes your basic "copy netvsc" approach for this which would be
default. It is how we would handle basic pass-thru back-up paths. If
the host decides to send multicast/broadcast traffic from the host up
through it that is a host side decision. I am okay with our default
transmit behavior from the guest being to send everything through the
pass-thru interface. All the virtio would be doing is advertising that
it is a side channel for some sort of bond with another interface. By
calling it a side channel it implies that it isn't the direct channel
for the interface, but it is an alternative communications channel for
things like backup, and other future uses.

There end up being a few different "phase 2" concepts I have floating
around which I want to avoid limiting. Solving the east/west problem
is an example. In my mind that just becomes a bonding Tx mode that is
controlled via the pass-thru interface. The VF could black-list the
local addresses so that they instead fall into the virtio interface.
In addition I seem to recall watching a presentation from Mellanox
where they were talking about a VF per NUMA node in a system which
would imply multiple VFs with the same MAC address. I'm not sure how
the current patch handles that. Obviously that would require a more
complex load balancing setup. The bonding solution ends up being a way
to resolve that so that they could just have it take care of picking
the right Tx queue based on the NUMA affinity and fall back to the
virtio/netvsc when those fail.

I'm not sure about having the guest have to learn. In my mind the VF
should know who is local and who isn't. In the case of SwitchDev it
should be possible for the port representors and the switch to provide
data on which interfaces are bonded on the host side and which aren't.
With that data it would be pretty easy to just put together a list of
addresses that would prefer to go the para-virtual route instead of
being transmitted through physical hardware.

In addition a bridge implies much more overhead since normally a
bridge can receive a packet in on one interface and transmit it on
another. We don't really need that. This is more of a VEPA type setup
and doesn't need to be anything all that complex. You could probably
even handle the Tx queue selection via a simple eBPF program and map
since the input for whatever is used to select Tx should be pretty
simple, destination MAC, source NUMA node, etc, and the data-set
shouldn't be too large.

I would argue that BACKUP is too specific. I can see many other uses
other than just being a backup interface and I don't want us to box
ourselves in. I agree that it makes sense for active/backup to be the
base mode, but I really don't think it conveys all of the
possibilities since I see this as possibly being able to solve
multiple issues as this evolves. I'm also open to other suggestions.
We could go with PASSTHRU_SIDE_CHANNEL for instance, I just didn't
suggest that since it seemed kind of wordy.
