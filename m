I think it only needs to remain the default in cases where the
alternative (bus addressing) won't work.  I think that, so far, this
is just ppc64.  But see below...

I think the cleanest way of all would be to get the bus drivers to do
the right thing so that all of the virtio code can just use the dma
api.  I don't know whether this is achievable.

I don't think so.  I would argue that it's a straight-up bug for QEMU
to expose a physically-addressed virtio-pci device to the guest behind
an emulated IOMMU.  QEMU may already be doing that on ppc64, but it
isn't on x86_64 or arm (yet).

On x86_64, I'm pretty sure that QEMU can emulate an IOMMU for
everything except the virtio-pci devices.  The ACPI DMAR stuff is
quite expressive.

On ARM, I hope the QEMU will never implement a PCI IOMMU.  As far as I
could tell when I looked last week, none of the newer QEMU-emulated
ARM machines even support PCI.  Even if QEMU were to implement a PCI
IOMMU on some future ARM machine, it could continue using virtio-mmio
for virtio devices.

So ppc might actually be the only system that has or will have
physically-addressed virtio PCI devices that are behind an IOMMU.  Can
this be handled in a ppc64-specific way?  Is there any way that the
kernel can distinguish a QEMU-provided virtio PCI device from a
physical PCIe thing?  It would be kind of nice to address this without
adding complexity to the virtio spec.  Maybe virtio 1.0 devices could
be assumed to use bus addressing unless a new devicetree property says
otherwise.
