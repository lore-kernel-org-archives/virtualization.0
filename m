It was never unloadable; while the driver defined an exit routine, 
there were couple of issues unloading the vmbus driver:
 
1) All guest resources given to the host could not be recovered.

2) Windows host would not permit reloading the driver without 
rebooting the guest.

All I did was acknowledge the current state and cleanup 
accordingly. This is not unique to Hyper-V; for what it is worth,
the Xen platform_pci  driver which is equivalent to the vmbus driver
is also not unlodable (the last time I checked).

This needs to be fixed on the host side. I have notified them of the issue.

These drivers only load when Linux is hosted on  a Hyper-V platform;
I am not sure why it is a "big commitment" given that the host does not 
permit reloading this driver without rebooting the guest.
