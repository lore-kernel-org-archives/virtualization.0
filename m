It doesn't have to be in the (OF) device tree, but I think it absolutely makes
sense to use the 'struct device' infrastructure here, as almost everything uses
a device, and the ones that don't do that today can be easily changed.

The method you describe here makes sense for PCI devices that are required to support
legacy interrupts and may or may not support MSI on a given system, but not so much
for platform devices for which we know exactly whether we want to use MSI
or legacy interrupts.

In particular if you have a device that can only do MSI, the entire pci_enable_msi
step is pointless: all we need to do is program the correct MSI target address/message
pair into the device and register the handler.

Sorry for being unclear here: I did suggest changing all drivers now. What I meant
is that we use a different API for non-PCI devices that works without IRQ numbers.
I don't think we should touch the PCI interfaces at this point.

Makes sense. I'd have to think about it more, but I think you are right
about the affinity APIs needing this.

Which drivers are you thinking of? Again, I wouldn't expect to change any PCI drivers,
but only platform drivers that do native MSI, so we only have to change drivers that
do not support any MSI at all yet and that need to be changed anyway in order to add
support.

We have introduced the "msi-parent" property to mirror the "interrupt-parent" property.
For the PCI case, this property is only needed in the PCI host controller, and there
can be a system-wide default, by putting the "msi-parent" property into the root device
node or the node of a bus that is parent to all devices supporting MSI.

For non-PCI devices, it should be possible to override the "msi-parent" property per
device, but those can also use the global property.

The main use case that I see are PCI host controllers that have their own MSI catcher
included, so meaning that any PCI device can either send its MSIs there, or to a
system-wide GICv3 instance, and we need a way to select which one.

A degenerate case of this would be a system where a PCI device sends its MSI into
the host controller, that generates a legacy interrupt and that in turn gets 
sent to an irqchip which turns it back into an MSI for the GICv3. This would of
course be very inefficient, but I think we should be able to express this with
both the binding and the in-kernel framework just to be on the safe side.
