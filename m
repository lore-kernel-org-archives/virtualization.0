The existing assumptions around SR-IOV VF and thus PCI is implicit. A
lot of simplications are built on the fact that the passthrough device
is a SR-IOV Virtual Function specifically than others: MAC addresses
for couple devices must be the same, changing MAC address is
prohibited, programming VLAN filter is challenged, the datapath of
virtio-net has to share the same physical function where VF belongs
to. There's no hankshake during datapath switching at all to support a
normal passthrough device at this point. I'd imagine some work around
that ahead, which might be a bit involved than just to support a
simplified model for VF migration.

The look-for-MAC matching scheme is not ideal in many aspects. I don't
want to repeat those again, but once the group UUID is added to QEMU,
the failover driver is supposed to switch to the UUID based matching
scheme in the guest.

Of course, technically it doesn't have to be virtio-pci only. The
group UUID can even extend it further to non-pci transport. However,
with the current focus of the driver support on SR-IOV VF and limited
use case on non-pci, I'd feel no immediate effort will be needed on
that front.

OK. Thanks for the discussion, it's really useful.
