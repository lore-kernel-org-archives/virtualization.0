How can it be unclear? If, for example, the outcome is permitted on that
CPU, then your original reasoning for the WRC+sync+addr doesn't apply
there and SYNC is not transitive. That's what I'm trying to get to the
bottom of.

Does the MIPS kernel target a particular CPU at compile time?

Are you saying that MIPS needs to implement [smp_]read_barrier_depends?

We may be highjacking the thread slightly, but there are much bigger
issues at play here if you want to start using lightweight barriers to
implement relaxed kernel primitives such as smp_load_acquire and
smp_store_release.
