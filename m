s/any feature/any combination of features/

This sounds like a good idea (for a later update).

I'm not really sure if we can find enough commonality between
architectures, unless you propose to have a function for checking
things like device memory only.

Yes, there's nothing wrong with the patch as-is.

Which tree should this go through? Virtio? s390?

It does change behaviour of virtio-ccw devices; but then, it only
fences off configurations that would not have worked anyway.
Distributions should probably pick this; but I do not consider it
strictly a "fix" (more a mitigation for broken configurations), so I'm
not sure whether stable applies.

Not sure if that feature name will ever change, as it is exported in
headers. At most, we might want to add the new ACCESS_PLATFORM define
and keep the old one, but that would still mean some churn.

"virtio: device does not work with limited memory access" ?

But no issue with keeping the current message.
