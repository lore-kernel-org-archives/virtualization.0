I'd just suggest doing what is simplest and can be done in the smallest
amount of code.  As long as it is functional in some way and can be
extended to cover the end goal, I say keep it tiny.

I think what Fernando is suggesting is that we *allow* each disk to be
treated separately, not that we actually separate them out.  I agree
that with large disk count systems, it would get a bit nutty to deal
with I/O limits on each of them.  It would also probably be nutty for
some dude with two disks in his system to have to set (or care about)
individual limits.

I guess I'm just arguing that we should allow pretty arbitrary grouping
of block devices into these resource pools.
