My first reaction is: Sounds sensible, but it would be good to have a
spec for this :)

You'll need a spec if you want this to go forward anyway, so at least a
sketch would be good to answer questions such as how many virtqueues
you use for which purpose, what is actually put on the virtqueues,
whether there are negotiable features, and what the expectations for
the device and the driver are. It also makes it easier to understand
how this is supposed to work in practice.

If folks agree that this sounds useful, the next step would be to
reserve an id for the device type.
