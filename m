ok. Now with the new thought, I am completely deprecating the idea of
queuing the request descriptors. Now I am thinking of capturing the bios
and buffering these into the rb-tree as soon as these enter the request
queue using associated request function. All the request descriptor
allocation will come later when bios are actually release to elevator from
the rb-tree. That way we should be able to get rid of this issue.

Yes, one rb-tree per device, be it physical device or logical device
(because there is one request queue associated per physical/logical block
device).

I was thinking of getting hold/hijack the bios as soon as they are
submitted to the device using associated request function. So if there
is a logical device built on top of two physical device, the associated
bio copy or other logic should not even see the bio the moment it is 
submitted to the deivce. It will see the bio only when it is released
from associated rb-tree to them. Do you think this will not work? To me
this is what dm-ioband is doing logically. The only difference is that it
does this with the help of a separate request queue.
