This is so that all values are valid. E.g. param=0 -> use q1.

I actually think we need to work on more debug features.

No. Receive steering is done by device. Documented for driver writer's
benefit. xmit streering by driver. documented for device benefit.
They must match for tcp to work well so I doubt we will have
commands to control them separately.

Thanks for the comments will address!
