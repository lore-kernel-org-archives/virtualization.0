OK. I finally cleared some time to look over this and are reading the code
in details to make sure I have it clear in mind. I will most likely ask
some questions that are naive - hopefully they will lead to the code being
self-explanatory for anybody else taking a stab at understanding them when
bugs appear.

Looking forward to seeing it. Glancing over the KVM one and comparing it
to the original version that Waiman posted it should be fairly simple. Perhaps
even some of the code could be shared?
