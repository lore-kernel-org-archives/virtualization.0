It would be good to have a summary somewhere in the code (or
Documentation/) as to what needs the dma treatment and what doesn't,
for later reference. We don't want people to accidentally break things
(especially if they cannot refer to architecture documentation - or
will at least some of that be published?)

FWIW, I think reshuffling the patches in the next iteration would ease
review.

I would like some comments from people who have experience with the dma
api.

If we can find some generic names that work well for everyone,
converting seems like a good idea. But following SEV is not that bad,
either (you'll probably find more people who have heard about SEV than
folks familiar with s390 ;)

I have now read through the whole series and commented in some places.
But I'd really like to see comments from others as well.
