This is so correct. Guest does not not evict host page cache pages directly. 
In case of virtio-pmem & DAX, guest clears guest page cache exceptional entries.
Its solely decision of host to take action on the host page cache pages.

In case of virtio-pmem, guest does not modify host file directly i.e don't
perform hole punch & truncation operation directly on host file.
