It's been two months, but Frank Swiderski's patch that triggered the
debate is exactly that
(http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/1318984).  However, he
didn't check VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST, so he has a bug there.

Exactly, virtio migration currently fails if it would change hardware
due to features not supported in the destination.  Except for
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST, where it does not fail because it is
defined in the wrong direction.

That would be a one-off hack, for the sole feature that was defined wrong.

I'm talking of the code Frank should have put in the driver, but he
didn't (so he has a bug).  Something like

    if (virtio_has_feature(vb->vdev, VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST))
	return -ENODEV;

So it has to request the feature, and then fail if the feature is
present.  That's quite backwards.  Everywhere else you'll find

    if (!virtio_has_feature(vblk->vdev, VIRTIO_BLK_F_SCSI))
        return -ENOTTY;

    BUG_ON(!virtio_has_feature(vblk->vdev, VIRTIO_BLK_F_CONFIG_WCE));

    if (virtio_has_feature(vblk->vdev, VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_VQ)) {
        /* do cool stuff */
    }

etc.

No, it is the other way round.  The host ultimately decides what
features are negotiated, so it doesn't ask anything to the guest.  The
_guest_ is asking the host about the need for explicit deflate.

There's nothing that you cannot work around.  Use virtio_has_feature in
the device, invert the migration feature check in the driver.  Why not
just _get it right_ instead?

No, it's not broken.  A reverse feature, let's call it like
VIRTIO_NET_F_HOST_MUST_SEND_GARP, would be broken.

VIRTIO_NET_F_GUEST_ANNOUNCE is a "positive" feature: if set, the host
_can_ ask the guest to send a gARP, but it may also send it itself.
Similarly if VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_SILENT_DEFLATE is set, the guest _can_ use
ballooned pages directly, but may also deflate them explicitly.

Instead, VIRTIO_NET_F_HOST_MUST_SEND_GARP would be a "negative" feature:
if set, the host _may not_ rely on the guest to send a gARP.  Similarly
if VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST is set, the guest _may not_ use
ballooned pages directly.

There are _no_ other negative features besides
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST in the spec, and for a good
reason---because they're broken.

(Hmm, actually we have one, VIRTIO_BLK_F_RO.  It is also a bit broken,
but it is not so important because it depends on user input more than
hypervisor version).

Reasoning on migration is just another way to see if the feature is
positive.  During migration, new features available on the destination
can always be masked.  But if removing the feature _adds_ a capability
to the hardware, it's wrong.

Sure, but better fix broken things _before_ somebody uses them.

I'm not proposing to replace VIRTIO_BLK_F_RO with VIRTIO_BLK_F_RW
because it's in wide use and it would pose compatibility problems indeed.

But since VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST does not exist in any source
code, neither driver nor hypervisor, we get lucky and we can instantly
deprecate it.

Indeed, it will add one line of code to the hypervisor to advertise the
new feature.
