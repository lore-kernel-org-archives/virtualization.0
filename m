native means drivers for emulated hardware: ata_piix, piix.

Not really. The virtual IDE controllers are emulated hardware, while the
virtual SCSI controllers are paravirtualized hardware. KY, correct my if
I'm wrong here.

With the IDE disks, the module loading order matters because both
ata_piix/piix and hv_storvsc will bind to them. 
With the SCSI disks, only hv_storvsc will bind to them.

I agree, the modprobe.conf rules for hv should be removed. With this
patchset a rule to prevent ata_piix loading would hide all cdrom devices.

The GUI does not seem to offer a way to attach an iso to a virtual SCSI
controller. It looks like one can add up to 4 SCSI controllers, each one
can have up to 64 disk images.
DVD devices can only be attached to the 2 virtual IDE controllers, one
can either attach iso images or physical hardware.


After some more testing it looks like the hv_blkvsc driver claimed the
ide major #3, so the ide_core could not bind to the emulated IDE
hardware. The modprobe.conf rules prevented that ata_piix gets loaded.
If I force a module load order of 'ata_piix ;hv_blkvsc' both ata_piix
and hv_blkvsc will bind to the same drive, just as shown in my previous
mail. So there is appearently no way to shutdown the IDE ports like it
is done with xen_emul_unplug= option for Xen guests.

Maybe some hack is needed for a hyper-v specific unplug if Windows does
indeed lack that feature. Now that ata_piix is compiled into the kernel,
there is nothing to a modprobe.conf rule can "fix".
