Subject: [PATCH] vhost: correctly set bits of dirty pages
Date: Mon, 29 Nov 2010 13:48:20 +0800
Message-ID: <20101129054819.24923.26439.stgit@dhcp-91-7.nay.redhat.com.englab.nay.redhat.com>

List-Id: virtualization@lists.linuxfoundation.org

When counting pages we should increase it by 1 instead of VHOST_PAGE_SIZE,
and also make log_write() can correctly process the request across
pages with write_address not start at page boundary.
