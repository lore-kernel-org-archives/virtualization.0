Sorry, I meant if this was the original design idea of hinting, then we
would have a QEMU BUG as of now, as we might get get uninitialized data.
Makes sense?

The interesting part is that drivers/virtio/virtio_balloon.c mentions:

"Let the hypervisor know that we are expecting a specific value to be
written back in balloon pages.".

But I just realized that you introduced this comment, not the original
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON commit.

Should this have been "in reported pages when implicitly deflating them
by reusing them." or sth. like that?

Okay, we have basically no idea what was the intention of
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON with basic deflation/inflation as well. So
I think we can define what suits us.

On the deflate path, we could always simply fill with poison_val. But
there are nasty corner cases (esp. no VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_MUST_TELL_HOST).

What would be your suggestion? Also don't care about
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON on ordinary inflation/deflation? At this
point, I think this makes sense.
