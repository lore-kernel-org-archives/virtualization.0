(added various kvm/virtualization lists in Cc as well as qemu as I don't
know who's "wrong" here)

This isn't something I understand, but bisect tells me this patch
(landed as 857baa87b64 ("sched/clock: Enable sched clock early")) makes
a VM running with kvmclock take a step in uptime/printk timer early in
boot sequence as illustrated below. The step seems to be related to the
amount of time the host was suspended while qemu was running before the
reboot.

$ dmesg
...

(The VM is x86_64 on x86_64, I can provide my .config on request but
don't think it's related)


It's rather annoying for me as I often reboot VMs and rely on the
'uptime' command to check if I did just reboot or not as I have the
attention span of a goldfish; I'd rather not have to find something else
to check if I did just reboot or not.

Note that if the qemu process is restarted, there is no offset anymore.

I unfortunately just did that so cannot say with confidence (putting my
laptop to sleep for 30s only led to a 2s offset and I do not want to
wait longer right now), but it looks like the clock is still mostly
correct after reboot after disabling my VM's ntp client. Will infirm
that tomorrow if I was wrong.


Happy to try to help fixing this in any way, as written above the quote
I'm not even actually sure who is wrong here.

Thanks!



(As a side, mostly unrelated note, insert swearing here about cf7a63ef4
not compiling earlier in this serie; some variable declaration got
removed before their use. Was fixed in the next patch but I didn't
notice the kernel didn't fully rebuild and wasted time in my bisect
heading the wrong way...)
