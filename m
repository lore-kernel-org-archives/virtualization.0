Well, according to Pekka's reply it is spec'ed that way, for the
existing buffer types.  So for server allocated buffers you need
(a) a wayland protocol extension and (b) support for the extension
in the clients.

"cooperative clients" == "client which has support for the wayland
protocol extension", correct?

Ok.

Depends on the kind of region.  Guest RAM is allocated and mapped by
qemu, guest firmware can query qemu about RAM mappings using a special
interface, then create a e820 memory map for the guest os.  PCI device
bars are mapped according to the pci config space registers, which in
turn are initialized by the guest firmware, so it is basically in the
guests hand where they show up.

Yes.

Ah, good, that makes it alot easier.

So, yes, using ivshmem would be one option.  Tricky part here is the
buffer management though.  It's just a raw piece of memory.  The guest
proxy could mmap the pci bar and manage it.  But then it is again either
unmodified guest + copying the data, or modified client (which requests
buffers from guest proxy) for zero-copy.

Another idea would be extending stdvga.  Basically qemu would have to
use shmem as backing storage for vga memory instead of anonymous memory,
so it would be very  simliar to ivshmem on the host side.  But on the
guest side we have a drm driver for it (bochs-drm).  So clients can
allocate dumb drm buffers for software rendering, and the buffer would
already be backed by a host shmem segment.  Given that wayland already
supports drm buffers for 3d rendering that could work without extending
the wayland protocol.  The client proxy would have to translate the drm
buffer into an pci bar offset and pass it to the host side.  The host
proxy could register the pci bar as wl_shm_pool, then just pass through
the offset to reference the individual buffers.

Drawback of both approaches would be that software rendering and gpu
rendering would use quite different code paths.

We also need a solution for the keymap shmem block.  I guess the keymap
doesn't change all that often, so maybe it is easiest to just copy it
over (host proxy -> guest proxy) instead of trying to map the host shmem
into the guest?

cheers,
  Gerd
