All are RO.

To make it simple, I want to make the driver use all of the virtqueue
pairs we offered in max_virtqueue_pairs.

Right, let's make it explicit.

Sounds good to me.

ok.

Good point, but 32 bit tx_cnt and fwd_cnt counter overflow very easily
since it contains the total number of bytes ever transferred. If we can
to use 32 bit counter, we need to figure out how to handle overflow. (64
bit can overflow as well.)

buf_alloc can be 32 bit.

We have packed structures on scsi:

I can rename the shut field as a generic filed depending on op.

RST is used to handle this kind of errors.

SHUTDOWN follows shutdown (2) system call. I can write more details
about each packet types.
