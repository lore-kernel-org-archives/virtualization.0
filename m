Yes, it says:

 * flush_work - wait for a work to finish executing the last queueing instance
 * @work: the work to flush
 *
 * Wait until @work has finished execution.  This function considers
 * only the last queueing instance of @work.  If @work has been
 * enqueued across different CPUs on a non-reentrant workqueue or on
 * multiple workqueues, @work might still be executing on return on
 * some of the CPUs from earlier queueing.
 *
 * If @work was queued only on a non-reentrant, ordered or unbound
 * workqueue, @work is guaranteed to be idle on return if it hasn't
 * been requeued since flush started.

kvm uses the default workqueue which is non-reentrant.
Thanks to Gleb for the suggestion!
