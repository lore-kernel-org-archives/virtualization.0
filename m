OK, will change.

Actually EINTR isn't an error which needs to bail out. That's just the 
case that the vq is full, that hint isn't added. Maybe it is not 
necessary to treat the "vq full" case as an error.
How about just returning "0" when the vq is full, instead of returning 
"EINTR"? (The next hint will continue to be added)

Yes. Please see below, we could make some more change.

Because host and guest operations happen asynchronously. When the guest 
reaches here, host may have not put anything to the vq yet. How about 
doing this via the free page vq handler?
Host will send a free page vq interrupt before exiting the optimization. 
I think this would be nicer.
