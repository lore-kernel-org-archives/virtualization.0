Hi Sasha,

Thanks for taking a look.

Agreed, we're sorely lacking in proper documentation for the internal
protocol.  We're in the process of writing such a specification and
will post it to LKML next week at the latest.

Correct, we have a legacy protocol and a v2, the latter now being
the default.  This particular packet is sent by the client when
initiating a STREAM connection.  The sequence is REQUEST(2)->
NEGOTIATE(2)->OFFER->ACCEPT.  It will be properly documented in
the specification we post next week.

Thanks!
