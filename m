As requested by Michal, I will squash some patches.

I'll pull out the NID thingies from "virtio-mem: Paravirtualized memory
hotplug" and squash "ACPI: NUMA: export pxm_to_node" into that change.

Also, I'll squash "mm: Export alloc_contig_range() /
free_contig_range()" into "virtio-mem: Paravirtualized memory hotunplug
part 2". I'll not squash the other, more involved, MM patches.

Thanks!
