I haven't asked for adding complete support for MCSS-E, just to keep it
in the back of our minds...

Back to the issue at hand. You're currently hard-wiring this to the
css0 device. My question is: Does it make sense to have a per-css area?
From my limited perspective, I think it does (more css images would
mean more devices, and just adding smaller areas per-css is probably
easier than adding one big area scaling with the number of css images).
In that case, what about tacking the area to the actual css object,
instead of having the global variable? Should be an easy change, and
feels cleaner.
