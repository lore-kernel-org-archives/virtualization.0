I think it's a good point, we can try to implement this.

It looks like the only difference so far is there is a userspace
assistance in the case of VDUSE.

I think I agree with Michael, let's try to use MSI-X here where
there's a lot of existing optimizations in various layers.

Yes, used buffer length and IRQ hardening are reverted as we need to
deal with the legacy device more carefully. New version will be posted
in the near future.

Ok, so those drivers will talk to the VMM.

Yes, and it is done with the assistance of the userspace.

Right, you need to emulate a virtio device with an existing transport
anyhow. MMIO might be easy. If you want a PCI transport it means a
huge number of devices emulation needs to be done by the hypervisor.
