It's had no end of problems: the powerpc folk are quite upset with me.

If I were doing virtio again, I'd use LE everywhere: device authors
*expect* to worry about endian, and it's confusing for them when they
don't.

It's tempting to use LE for the PCI config space for the new layout, for
example.

If you want to specify virtio-mmio as LE, feel free.

Cheers,
Rusty.
