Hmm. Want to try fixing scsi? Need to be compatible but it could
maybe ignore spaces.

Make it bool then?

You are using u8 in the config. So you could get any value
besides 0 and 1, and you interpret that as 1.
Is 1 always a safe value? If not maybe it's better to set
to a safe value if it is not 0 or 1, that is we don't know how to interpret it.
