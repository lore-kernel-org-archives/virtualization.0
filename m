Thanks Greg. I look forward to your feedback.

I will continue to cleanup the block and network driver code. As you know the
util driver is also a client of the vmbus driver (as far as the communication with 
the host goes). So, it may still make sense to plan for getting the vmbus driver out 
of staging along with the util and the timesource driver.
