Just as a comment: On s390 we always considered the memory access as access to real memory (not device memory) for virtio accesses. I prefer to not touch the DMA API on s390 as it is quite s390-PCI specific but it is somewhat strange for CCW devices.

We would basically have two kinds of DMA mappings on s390 then, one iommu like for the PCI devices and one that maps DMA memory 1:1 to real memory. We would also need some buy-in from the s390 arch maintainers then.
