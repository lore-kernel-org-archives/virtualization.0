The additional register pressure may just cause a few more register 
moves which should be negligible in the overall performance . The 
additional icache pressure, however, may have some impact on 
performance. I was trying to balance the performance of the pv and 
non-pv versions so that we won't penalize the pv code too much for a bit 
more performance in the non-pv code. Doing it your way will add a lot of 
function call and register saving/restoring to the pv code.

Another alternative that I can think of is to generate 2 versions of the 
slowpath code - one pv and one non-pv out of the same source code. The 
non-pv code will call into the pv code once if pv is enabled. In this 
way, it won't increase the icache and register pressure of the non-pv 
code. However, this may make the source code a bit harder to read.

Please let me know your thought on this alternate approach.
