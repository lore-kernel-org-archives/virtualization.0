On s390, it would be more than strangeness. There's no implementation
of PCI at all, someone would have to cook it up - and it wouldn't have
any use beyond those special devices. Since there isn't any bus type
that is available on *all* architectures, a generic "virtual" bus with
very simple probing seems much saner...
