/me working very hard to get lguest64 ready for public display

Here's a snippet from my version of core.c.  I've been thinking of ways to
optimize it, but for now it works fine. This was done for both ring 3 and
ring 1 lguest versions (this is the host running):


	/*
	 * Update the LSTAR to point to the HV syscall handler.
	 * Also update the fsbase if the guest uses one.
	 */
	wrmsrl(MSR_LSTAR, (unsigned long)HV_OFFSET(&lguest_syscall_trampoline));

[...]
	asm volatile ("pushq %2; pushq %%rsp; pushfq; pushq %3; call *%6;"
		      /* The stack we pushed is off by 8, due to the
previous pushq */
		      "addq $8, %%rsp"
		      : "=D"(foo), "=a"(bar)
		      : "i" (__KERNEL_DS), "i" (__KERNEL_CS), "0"
(vcpu->vcpu),
			"1"(get_idt_table()),
			"r" (sw_guest)
		      : "memory", "cc");

[...]
	/* restore old LSTAR */
	wrmsrl(MSR_LSTAR, vcpu->host_syscall);



Also in the switcher.S (The Hypervisor):

.global lguest_syscall_trampoline
	.type lguest_syscall_trampoline, @function
lguest_syscall_trampoline:
	/*
	 * Tricky, we don't have much to choose from here.
	 * The only way to get to our stack is with swapgs.
	 * but we need to save the stack too, so we have to play
	 * very carefully.
	 */
	swapgs
	/* now gs points to our VCPU Guest Data */

	/* first save the stack! */
	movq	%rsp, %gs:LGUEST_GUEST_DATA_regs_rsp

	movq	%rdx, %gs:LGUEST_GUEST_DATA_regs_rdx

	 * If it is a bad address, we fault from the guest side
	 * and we kill the guest. No harm done to the host.
	 */
	pushq	$(__KERNEL_DS | 1)
	pushq	%gs:LGUEST_GUEST_DATA_regs_rsp
	pushfq
	/* Make sure we have actual interrupts on */
	orq	$(1<<9), 0(%rsp)
	pushq	$(__KERNEL_CS | 1)
	pushq	%gs:LGUEST_GUEST_DATA_LSTAR

	swapgs
	iretq



NOTE: This is still under development, since I'm going with a new design
change to try to stay more in sync with lguest32.
