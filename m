The guest hypervisor is Jailhouse and the guest is the root cell that
loaded the hypervisor, thus continues with identity mappings. You
usually don't have 1:1 mapping with other setups - maybe with some Xen
configuration? Dunno.

The ability to have virtio on systems with IOMMU in place makes testing
much more efficient for us. Ideally, we would have it in non-identity
mapping scenarios as well, e.g. to start secondary Linux instances in
the test VMs, giving them their own virtio devices. And we will
eventually have this need on ARM as well.

Virtio needs to be backward compatible, so the change to put these
devices under IOMMU control could be advertised during feature
negotiations and controlled on QEMU side via a device property. Newer
guest drivers would have to acknowledge that they support virtio via
IOMMUs. Older ones would refuse to work, and the admin could instead
spawn VMs with this feature disabled.
