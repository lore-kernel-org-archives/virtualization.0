As I've previously explained, that trait is a function of the
kvm-connector I've chosen to implement, not of the overall design of vbus=
=2E

The reason why my kvm-connector is designed that way is because my early
testing/benchmarking shows one of the issues in KVM performance is the
ratio of exits per IO operation are fairly high, especially as your
scale io-load.  Therefore, the connector achieves a substantial
reduction in that ratio by treating "interrupts" to the same kind of
benefits that NAPI brought to general networking: That is, we enqueue
"interrupt" messages into a lockless ring and only hit the IDT for the
first occurrence.  Subsequent interrupts are injected in a
parallel/lockless manner, without hitting the IDT nor incurring an extra
EOI.  This pays dividends as the IO rate increases, which is when the
guest needs the most help.

OTOH, it is entirely possible to design the connector such that we
maintain a 1:1 ratio of signals to traditional IDT interrupts.  It is
also possible to design a connector which surfaces as something else,
such as PCI devices (by terminating the connector in QEMU and utilizing
its PCI emulation facilities), which would naturally employ 1:1 mapping.

So if 1:1 mapping is a critical feature (I would argue to the contrary),
vbus can support it.

That is the point.  Most of it needs to be there for performance.  And
what doesn't need to be there for performance can either be:

a) skipped at the discretion of the connector/device-model designer

OR

b) included because its trivially small subset of the model (e.g. a
mac-addr attribute) and its nice to have a cohesive solution instead of
requiring a separate binary blob that can get out of sync, etc.

The example Ive provided to date (venet on kvm) utilizes (b), but it
certainly doesn't have to.  Therefore, I don't think vbus as a whole can
be judged on this one point.

Fair enough, but I don't think the Xen community will ever use it.

To your point, a vbus goal was to reduce the bus-model and
backend-device-model proliferation for environments served by Linux as
the host.  This naturally complements virtio's driver non-proliferation
goal, but probably excludes Xen for reasons beyond the lack of shmem
(since it has its own non-linux hypervisor kernel).

In any case, I've already stated that we simply make the virtio-shmem
(vbus-proxy-device) facility optionally defined, and unavailable on
non-shmem based architectures to work around that issue.

The alternative is that we abstract the shmem concept further (ala
->add_buf() from the virtqueue world) but it is probably pointless to
try to accommodate shared-memory if you don't really have it, and no-one
will likely use it.

Kind Regards,
-Greg
