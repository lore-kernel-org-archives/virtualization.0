Request descriptors are allocated just right before passing I/O requests
to the elevators. Even if you move the descriptor allocation point
before calling the dm/md drivers, the drivers can't make use of them.

When one of the dm drivers accepts a I/O request, the request
won't have either a real device number or a real sector number.
The request will be re-mapped to another sector of another device
in every dm drivers. The request may even be replicated there.
So it is really hard to find the right request queue to put
the request into and sort them on the queue.

It's possible the algorithm of dm-ioband can be placed in the block layer
if it is really a big problem.
But I doubt it can control every control block I/O as we wish since
the interface the cgroup supports is quite poor.

Nope. Dm-ioband doesn't have this issue since it works before allocating
the descriptors. Only I/O requests dm-ioband has passed can allocate its
descriptor.

I feel this is almost what dm-ioband is doing.
