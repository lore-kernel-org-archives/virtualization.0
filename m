That's tail call/sibling call optimization. No unwinder can untangle that
because the return address is lost.  But it's also an quite important optimization.

Most functions have quite small frames, so 20-30 is still not a problem

There are many sanity checks in the unwind code and it will fall back
to the old unwinder when it gets stuck.

No, me and Jan fixed all reported bugs as far as I know.
