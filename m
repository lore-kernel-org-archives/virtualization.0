I'm working on a followup patchset to address current feedback. I think
it will be cleaner to do a debugfs implementation for per-receive queue
packet buffer size exporting, so I'm trying that out.

I agree -- we can do precise buffer total len tracking. Something like
struct mergeable_packet_buffer_ctx {
   void *buf;
   unsigned int total_len;
};

Each receive queue could have a pointer to an array of N buffer contexts,
where N is queue size (kzalloc'd in init_vqs or similar). That would
allow us to allocate all of our buffer context data at startup.

Would this be preferred to the current approach or is there another
approach you would prefer? All other things being equal, having precise
length tracking is advantageous, so I'm inclined to try this out and
see how it goes.

I think this is a big design point - for example, if we have an extra
buffer context structure, then per-receive queue frag allocators are not
required for auto-tuning and we can reduce the number of patches in
this patchset.

I'm happy to implement either way.  Thanks!

Best,

Mike
