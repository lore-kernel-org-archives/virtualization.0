Thanks for this summary (and Jason, too).  I've fallen a long way behind
NIC state-of-the-art.

But this happens on real hardware today.  Better that real hardware is
nice, but is it overkill?

And can't you reorder even with perfect matching, since prior packets
will be on the old queue and more recent ones on the new queue?  Does it
discard or requeue old ones?  Or am I missing a trick?

Thanks,
Rusty.
