Because other people see the KConfig option (so, they may enable it) and 
they don't see the kernel parameter (so, they won't enable it).

Close your eyes and say how many kernel parameters do you remember :-)

I can't test if all the networking drivers use kvmalloc properly, because 
I don't have the hardware. You can't test it neither. No one has all the 
hardware that is supported by Linux.

Driver issues can only be tested by a mass of users. And if the users 
don't know about the debugging option, they won't enable it.

BTW. You can enable slub debugging either with CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON or 
with the kernel parameter "slub_debug" - and most users who compile their 
own kernel use CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON - just because it is visible.

This vmalloc fallback is similar to CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE. 
CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE changes the behavior of kobject_put in order 
to cause deliberate crashes (that wouldn't happen otherwise) in drivers 
that misuse kobject_put. In the same sense, we want to cause deliberate 
crashes (that wouldn't happen otherwise) in drivers that misuse kvmalloc.

The crashes will only happen in debugging kernels, not in production 
kernels.
