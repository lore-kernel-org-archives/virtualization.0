Some of us are actually doing it. ;-)

That's because hunting in include/linux/ is much more fruitful -- it
decreases amount of code after preprocessing for everyone. Below are
allyesconfig on x86_64 results for some kernels:

	$ wc ../*.i
	   79018171   229433654  2049266884 ../2.6.18.i
	   86568111   250674099  2245115663 ../2.6.19.i
	   85187296   247470579  2221334183 ../2.6.20.i		<===
	   88645422   242396928  2234855428 ../2.6.21.i
	   93897302   257990496  2377174442 ../2.6.22.i
	   98381373   268683402  2486321956 ../2.6.23.i

E.g. we can have ~1.07% decrease in cpp output despite ~126000 lines
added between .19 and .20.

Yup! Provided they're compile-tested sufficiently well.

That way you'll never clean anything especially during merge window. ;-)
