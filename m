Hi. This patchset implements ia64/xen domU support based on
ia64/pv_ops frame work which was sent as another patchest.
Changes from take 5 are rebased to Linux 2.6.26-rc3,
bug fix ivt.S paravirtualization and multi entry point support.
I believe these patches can be applied to the linux ia64 repository.

This patchset does the followings.
- Some preparation work. Mainly importing header files to define
  related structures.
- Then, define functions related to hypercall which is the way to
  communicate with Xen hypervisor.
- Add some helper functions which is necessary to utilize
  xen arch generic portion.
- Next implements the xen instance of pv_ops introducing
  pv_info, pv_init_ops, pv_cpu_ops and its assembler counter part,
  pv_iosapic_ops, pv_irq_ops and, pv_time_ops step by step.
- Introduce xen machine vector to describe xen platform.
  By using machine vector, xen domU implementation can be simplified.
- Lastly update Kconfig to allow paravirtualization support and
  xen domU support to compile.


The working full source is available from
http://people.valinux.co.jp/~yamahata/xen-ia64/linux-2.6-xen-ia64.git/
branch: xen-ia64-2008may19

At this phase, we don't address the following issues.
Those will be addressed after the first merge.
- optimization by binary patch
  In fact, we had the patch to do that, but we intentionally dropped
  for patch size/readability/cleanness.
- freeing the unused pages, i.e. pages for unused ivt.S.

Changes from take 5:
- rebased to Linux 2.6.26-rc3
- fix ivt.S paravirtualization.
  One instruction was wrongly paravirtualized.
  It wasn't revealed with Xen HVM domain so far, but with real hw
- multi entry point support.
- revised changelog to add CCs.

Changes from take 4:
- fix synch bit ops definitions to prevent accidental namespace clashes.
- rebased and fixed breakages due to the upstream change.

Changes from take 3:
- split the patch set into pv_op part and xen domU part.
- many clean ups.
- introduced pv_ops: pv_cpu_ops and pv_time_ops.

Changes from take 2:
- many clean ups following to comments.
- clean up:assembly instruction macro.
- introduced pv_ops: pv_info, pv_init_ops, pv_iosapic_ops, pv_irq_ops.

Changes from take 1:
Single IVT source code. compile multitimes using assembler macros.

thanks,
