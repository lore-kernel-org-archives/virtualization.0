I'll see if I can come up with something simple for v0.5, but it seems
like a big chunk of work. I don't really know what to report to the guest
at the moment. I don't want to report vendor-specific details about the
fault, but it should still be useful content, to let the guest decide
whether they need to reset/kill the device or just print something

Thanks for the explanation. So it is only legacy, and enabling nested mode
would be forbidden for a device with Reserved System Memory regions? I'm
wondering if virtio-iommu RESV regions will be extended to affect a
specific PASIDs (or all requests-with-PASID) in the future.

Yes it can be the host IOMMU driver, or simply Qemu sending VFIO ioctls to
create those identity mappings (they are reported in sysfs reserved_regions).

It has to be IOVA->GPA->HPA. So it'll be a bit complicated to implement
for us, I think we're going to need a VFIO ioctl to tell the host what
IOVA the guest allocated for its MSI, but it's not ideal.

Thanks,
