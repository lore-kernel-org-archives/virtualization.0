I think I mention too little in the cover message.

There's no much changes with Krishna's series except the method that 
choosing a rx virtqueue. Since original series use different hash 
methods in host (rxhash) and guest (txhash), a different virtqueue were 
chose for a flow which could lead packets of a flow to be handled by 
different vhost thread and vcpu. This may damage the performance.

This series tries to let one vhost thread to process the packets of a 
flow and also let the packets to be sent directly to a vcpu local to the 
thread process the data. This is done by letting guest tell the desired 
queue form which it want to receive the pakcet of a dedicated flow.

So passing the hash from host to guest is needed to get the same hash in 
the two sides. Then a guest programmable hash to queue table were 
introduced and guest co-operate with the host through accelerate RFS in 
guest.
