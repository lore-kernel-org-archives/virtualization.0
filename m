I did some testing of indirect descriptors under different workloads.

All tests were on a 2 vcpu guest with vhost on. Simple TCP_STREAM using
netperf.

Indirect desc off:
guest -> host, 1 stream: ~4600mb/s
host -> guest, 1 stream: ~5900mb/s
guest -> host, 8 streams: ~620mb/s (on average)
host -> guest, 8 stream: ~600mb/s (on average)

Indirect desc on:
guest -> host, 1 stream: ~4900mb/s
host -> guest, 1 stream: ~5400mb/s
guest -> host, 8 streams: ~620mb/s (on average)
host -> guest, 8 stream: ~600mb/s (on average)

Which means that for one stream, guest to host gets faster while host to
guest gets slower when indirect descriptors are on.
