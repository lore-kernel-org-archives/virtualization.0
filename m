Good to see this discussion going. I share the same feeling that the
decision of plugging the primary (passthrough) should only be made
until guest driver acknowledges DRIVER_OK and _F_STANDBY.
Architecturally this intelligence should be baken to QEMU itself
rather than moving up to management stack, such as libvirt.

A few questions in line below.

I wonder if you envision this flag as a user interface or some
internal attribute/property to QEMU device?

Since QEMU needs to associate this particular primary-failover device
with a virtio standby instance for checking DRIVER_OK as you indicate
below, I wonder if the group ID thing will be helpful to set
"primary-failover" flag internally without having to add another
option in CLI?

Sounds OK. While there might be a small window the guest already
starts to use virtio interface before the passthrough gets plugged in,
I think that should be fine.

Another option is to wait until the primary appears and gets
registered in the guest, so it can bring up the upper failover
interface.

Agreed.

For legacy guest, user might prefer seeing a single passthrough device
rather than a virtio device. I would hope there's an option to allow
it to happen, instead of removing all passthrough devices.
