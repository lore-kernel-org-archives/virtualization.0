Interesting!

So, VMs handled with /dev/vhost-vsock will be reachable from any netns (as
it happens now) and VMs handled with /dev/vhost-vsock-netns will be
reachable only from the same netns of the process that opens it.

It requires more changes, but we will preserve the previous behavior,
adding the new feature!

Thanks a lot for this idea! I'll try to implement it!
