The problem with the bond and team drivers is they are too large and
have too many interfaces available for configuration so as a result
they can really screw this interface up.

Essentially this is meant to be a bond that is more-or-less managed by
the host, not the guest. We want the host to be able to configure it
and have it automatically kick in on the guest. For now we want to
avoid adding too much complexity as this is meant to be just the first
step. Trying to go in and implement the whole solution right from the
start based on existing drivers is going to be a massive time sink and
will likely never get completed due to the fact that there is always
going to be some other thing that will interfere.

My personal hope is that we can look at doing a virtio-bond sort of
device that will handle all this as well as providing a communication
channel, but that is much further down the road. For now we only have
a single bit so the goal for now is trying to keep this as simple as
possible.

I think you might have missed the point of this. This is meant to be a
simple interface so the guest should not be able to change the MAC
address, and it shouldn't require any userspace daemon to setup or
tear down. Ideally with this solution the virtio bypass will come up
and be assigned the name of the original virtio, and the "backup"
interface will come up and be assigned the name of the original virtio
with an additional "nbackup" tacked on via the phys_port_name, and
then whenever a VF is added it will automatically be enslaved by the
bypass interface, and it will be removed when the VF is hotplugged
out.

In my mind the difference between this and bond or team is where the
configuration interface lies. In the case of bond it is in the kernel.
If my understanding is correct team is mostly in user space. With this
the configuration interface is really down in the hypervisor and
requests are communicated up to the guest. I would prefer not to make
virtio_net dependent on the bonding or team drivers, or worse yet a
userspace daemon in the guest. For now I would argue we should keep
this as simple as possible just to support basic live migration. There
has already been discussions of refactoring this after it is in so
that we can start to combine the functionality here with what is there
in bonding/team, but the differences in configuration interface and
the size of the code bases will make it challenging to outright merge
this into something like that.
