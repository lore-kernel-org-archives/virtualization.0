I don't think guest drivers recover gracefully from this.

Not sure.  This was not always the case. Further
setup can fail with e.g ENOMEM and
driver could retry with a set of more conservative features.

I do think it would be nice to add a generic way for device to
notify guest about an internal failure.
This can only happen after DRIVER_OK status is written though,
and since existing drivers do not expect such failure, it might
be too late.

Yes but why is being silent any good? Optimization?
Any data to show that it will help some workload?

Not sure I follow the logic.
They don't ack SILENT so that would be 100% exact.
