The problem with stacking devices is that we do not know how the IO
going through the leaf nodes contributes to the aggregate throughput
seen by the application/cgroup that generated it, which is what end
users care about.

The block device could be a plain old sata device, a loop device, a
stacking device, a SSD, you name it, but their topologies and the fact
that some of them do not even use an elevator should be transparent to
the user.

If you wanted to do resource management at the leaf nodes some kind of
topology information should be passed down to the elevators controlling
the underlying devices, which in turn would need to work cooperatively.

For the reasons stated above the two level scheduling approach seems
cleaner to me.

Please notice that the such an IO controller would only get in the way
of the elevator in case of contention for the device. What is more,
depending on the workload it turns out that buffering at higher layers
in a per-cgroup or per-task basis, like dm-band does, may actually
increase the aggregate throughput (I think that the dm-band team
observed this behavior too). The reason seems to be that bios buffered
in such way tend to be highly correlated and thus very likely to get
merged when released to the elevator.

If deemed necessary this case could be handled too, but it does not look
like a show-stopper.

As discussed above, I still think that the two level scheduling approach
makes more sense. Regarding the sharing of cgroup code among IO
schedulers I am all for it. If we consider that elevators should only
care about maximizing usage of the underlying devices, implementing
other non-hardware-dependent scheduling disciplines (that prioritize
according to the task or cgroup that generated the IO, for example) at
higher layers so that we can reuse code makes a lot of sense.

Thanks,
