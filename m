        Actually, I wouldn't expect it to work at all; the qemu-kvm
patch (particularly the feature bit setting bug fix) is required.
Without it, I think the existing code will tell the guest to use
mergeable buffers while turning it off in vhost. That was completely
non-functional for me -- what version of qemu-kvm are you using?
        What I did to test w/o mergeable buffers is turn off the
bit in VHOST_FEATURES. I'll recheck these, but qemu-kvm definitely
must be updated; the original doesn't correctly handle feature bits.

                                                                +-DLS
