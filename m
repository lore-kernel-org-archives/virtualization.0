I am sorry that I don't quite get what you mean here. My point is that 
in the hashing step, a cpu will need to scan an empty bucket to put the 
lock in. In the interim, an previously used bucket before the empty one 
may get freed. In the lookup step for that lock, the scanning will stop 
because of an empty bucket in front of the target one.
