Sure, just wanted to point it out. If this is "enable the common I/O
layer, except for QDIO" or so, that would sound fine to me :)

Yeah, that "control blocks" or "communication blocks" leaves me a bit
fuzzy :)

So, what is a high-level summary of areas that need the treatment?
What I get from looking at the patches so far, it's:
- stuff that is written by the hypervisor's interrupt injection code:
  IRB, indicators, etc.
- buffers that are filled by a channel program: sense, sense id, etc.
- ccws themselves (because of translation?)
