Amit,

Ah, indeed.  I am not using MSI-X, so virtio_pci::vp_try_to_find_vqs()
calls vp_request_intx() and sets up an interrupt callback.  From
there, when an interrupt occurs, the stack looks something like this:

virtio_pci::vp_interrupt()
  virtio_pci::vp_vring_interrupt()
    virtio_ring::vring_interrupt()
      vq->vq.callback()  <-- in this case, that's virtio_console::control_i=
ntr()
        workqueue::schedule_work()
          workqueue::queue_work()
            queue_work_on(get_cpu())  <-- queues the work on the current CP=
U.

I'm not doing anything to keep multiple control message from being
sent concurrently to the guest, and we will take those interrupts on
any CPU. I've confirmed that the two instances of
handle_control_message() are occurring on different CPUs.

Should this work?  I don't see anywhere that QEMU is serializing the
sending of data to the control queue in the guest, and there's no
serialization in
the control_intr.  I don't understand why you are not seeing the
concurrent execution of handle_control_message().  Are you taking all
your interrupts on a single CPU, maybe?  Or is there some other
serialization in user space?

Miche
