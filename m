We could split this patch into

MHP_NO_FIRMWARE_MEMMAP (create firmware memmap entries)

and

MHP_DRIVER_MANAGED (name of the resource)

See below, the latter might not be needed.

The only two users of /proc/iomem I am aware of are kexec-tools and some
s390x tools.

kexec-tools on x86-64 uses /sys/firmware/memmap to craft the initial
memmap, but uses /proc/iomem to
a) Find places for kexec images
b) Detect memory regions to dump via kdump

I am not yet sure if we really need the "System RAM (driver managed)"
part. If we can teach kexec-tools to
a) Don't place kexec images on "System RAM" that has a parent resource
(most likely requires kexec-tools changes)
b) Consider for kdump "System RAM" that has a parent resource
we might be able to avoid renaming that. (I assume that's already done)

E.g., regarding virtio-mem (patch #3) I am currently also looking into
creating a parent resource instead, like dax/kmem to avoid the rename:

:/# cat /proc/iomem
00000000-00000fff : Reserved
[...]
100000000-13fffffff : System RAM
140000000-33fffffff : virtio0
  140000000-147ffffff : System RAM
  148000000-14fffffff : System RAM
  150000000-157ffffff : System RAM
340000000-303fffffff : virtio1
  340000000-347ffffff : System RAM
3280000000-32ffffffff : PCI Bus 0000:00
