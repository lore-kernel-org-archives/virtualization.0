I guess I will have to go back and re-read that code - I do not remember
what does TUN_F_CSUM does by now.  Here is a quick question that might
help me:

Let's assume userspace does not set TUN_F_SCTP_CSUM and device
does not calculate the checksums either. I would expect that with
macvtap this then behaves exactly like now with no overhead.

Well that's not really the case I think. What we have is controls for tx
offloads for tun. That's TUN_F_CSUM.
there are no rx offloads - userspace can send what it wants.

These are supposed to translate to rx offloads for macvtap.
tx offloads shouldn't be affected at all.

Maybe that's not the case - as I said need to go back and check.
Will try to find the time in the next couple of days.

So assuming TUN_F_CSUM affects tx for macvtap do you
agree it's a bug? And should we add to it with
TUN_F_SCTP_CSUM doing the same?
