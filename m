Oh, thanks for that! I didn't realize Linux is doing this.

So it seems that with modern Linux, all one needs
to do on x86 is mark the device as untrusted.
It's already possible to do this with ACPI and with OF - would that be
sufficient for achieving what this patchset is trying to do?

Adding more ways to mark a device as untrusted, and adding
support for more platforms to use bounce buffers
sounds like a reasonable thing to do.
