In theory, it's yes to both questions.
In practice, with patches merged recently it's no to both questions :).

It's a work in progress, but some extra effort to support miltiple
PCI roots will be needed on the QEMU side.
What problems will surface when we try to do multiple roots?
Only time will tell.

If it's felt that it's much cleaner to make PPC the odd one out, we can
defer enabling iommu in qemu on x86 until ways to bypass it are
implemented.

But I would be inclined, for pre-1.0 drivers, to make Xen weird.
For 1.0 drivers, we have a bit of time to consider this,
and maybe PPC guys can come up with some way (can be PV)
to tell guest "these devices bypass the IOMMU".
