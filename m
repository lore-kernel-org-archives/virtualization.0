- obvious improvement on TCP_RR (at most 12%)
- improvement on guest RX
- huge decreasing on Guest TX (at most -75%), this is probably because
virtio-net driver suffers from buffer bloat by orphaning skb before
transmission. The faster vhost it is, the smaller packet it could
produced. To reduce the impact on this, turning off gso in guest can
result the following result:

- latency get improved a little bit
- small improvement on single session rx
- no other obvious changes
- this may because 8 vcpu could give enough stress on a single vhost
thread. Then the busy polling was not trigged enough (unless on light
load case e.g 1 session TCP_RR).

3) 8 vcpus 8 queues

- TCP_RR get obviously improved (at most 17%)
- obvious improvement on Guest TX (at most 44%)
