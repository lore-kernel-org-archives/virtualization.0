Sure, the comment explains that we use an atomic because _elsewhere_ the
tgt_lock is not held while modifying reqs.

Ok.

Ok.

If you have two incoming requests at the same time, req_vq is also
modified when the target is not idle; that's the point of the lock.

Suppose tgt->reqs = 0 initially, and you have two processors/queues.
Initially tgt->req_vq is queue #1.  If you have this:

    queuecommand on CPU #0         queuecommand #2 on CPU #1
  --------------------------------------------------------------
    atomic_inc_return(...) == 1
                                   atomic_inc_return(...) == 2
                                   virtscsi_queuecommand to queue #1
    tgt->req_vq = queue #0
    virtscsi_queuecommand to queue #0

then two requests are issued to different queues without a quiescent
point in the middle.

Well, I could also let tgt->reqs go negative, but it would be a bit untidy.

Another alternative is to access the target's target_busy field with
ACCESS_ONCE, and drop reqs altogether.  Too tricky to do this kind of
micro-optimization so early, though.

Not measurable in my experiments.
