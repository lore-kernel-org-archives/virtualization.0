Not necessarily, although the example above is extreme.  Redundant 
interfaces is the norm in an evolving platform.

Not inherently.  Of course, there may be interfaces which are interently 
or by policy mutually exclusive, but a hypervisor should only export the 
interfaces it wants a guest to be able to use.

This is particularly so with CPUID, which is a *data export* interface, 
it doesn't perform any action.
