Do you refer to "If host corrupts memory it's broken"?
You think that's not true?

Reporting is like that. But hinting isn't, simply because
by the time host gets the hint page may already be in use.
Blowing it out unconditionally would lead to easily
reproducible guest crashes.

Not exactly true. We do a delicate play with
the two dirty bits so they *are* migrated sometimes.

Well no, original author repeatedly stated it's "hinting"
because page can be in use actually.

It's a reasonable option. however ...

I don't see how you can say that. ATM on a host without POISON
and with HINT, with poison val !=3D 0 and with validation,
host can blow a free page away and then guest will detect
that as corruption.

If guest crashes then either guest or host are broken ;)
