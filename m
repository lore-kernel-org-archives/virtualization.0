It might have been interesting several years ago, but now that linux has
vhost-net in kernel, the only point seems to be to
speed up networking on non-linux hosts. Since non-linux
does not have kvm, I doubt virtio is a bottleneck.
IMO yet another networking backend is a distraction,
and confusing to users.
In any case, I'd like to see virtio-blk dataplane replace
non dataplane first. We don't want two copies of
virtio-net in qemu.
