I do agree, and that's why I suggested that instead of doing what it
does, that patch should instead:

  - Always use dma_map_*

  - Make the dma "ops" of the virtio bus/device point to a set of "null
ops" when necessary.

This would also make my life easier on powerpc since I will too have
cases where I will want virtio to use the dma mapping API, it's just
that the *current* implementation is such that qemu always bypasses
iommus and we want to keep that mode of operations as an option (even
the default) for performances.

But qemu isn't the only other implementation of virtio ...
