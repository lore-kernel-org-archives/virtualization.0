vlans are like this too, aren't they?

For 2 virtio devices, we can disable the bond to make it deterministic.

That's more or less a feature. If you want configurability, just use
any of the existing generic solutions (team,bond,bridge,...).

With netvsc? That precludes a separate device though because of
compatibility.

I'm not sure I understand how "separate device" is different from
"separate netdev". Do you advocate for a special device who's job is
just to tell the guest "bind these two devices together"?

Yea, sure, that works. However for sure it's more work to
implement and manage at all levels. Further

- it doesn't answer the question
- a feature bit in a virtio device is cheap enough that
  I wouldn't worry too much about this feature
  going unused later.

saparate netdev has the same property

In fact we have a virtio feature bit for the fallback.
So this part does not depend on how software in guest works
and does not need software solutions.
