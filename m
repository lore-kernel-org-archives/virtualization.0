As the batching size is variable, driver has to detect validity of each descriptor unless the number of incoming valid descriptor is predictable, being curious on the benefits of driver from VRING_DESC_F_MORE to take  batching descriptors as a single transaction. On device perspective, it's great to write out one descriptor for the whole chain. However, it assumes no other useful fields in each descriptor of chain needs to write. TX buffer reclaiming can be the candidate, while RX side has to update 'len' at least. Even for this purpose, instead of writing out VRING_DESC_F_MORE on a few descriptors to suppress device writing back, it's cheaper to set flag (e.g. VRING_DESC_F_WB) on single descript
 or of chain to hint the expected position for device to write back.

But driver does not really benefit from batching and does not know how
many to batch, this depends on device. E.g. a software device does not
need batching at all, a pci express device would want batches to be
multiples of what fits in a pci express transaction, etc.  We would have
to provide that info from device to driver.

> - s/g chain: It makes sense to indicate the packet boundary. Considering in-order descriptor ring without VRING_DESC_F_INDIRECT, the next descriptor always belongs to the same s/g chain until end of packet indicators occur. So one alternative approach is only to set a flag (e.g. VRING_DESC_F_EOP) on the last descriptor of the chain. 

EOP would be the reverse of NEXT then? I think it does not matter much,
but NEXT matches what is there in virtio 1.0 right now. It also means that
simple implementations with short buffers can have flags set to 0 which
seems cleaner.

For RX mergeable buffers, a packet is composed of multiple s/g chains.

This is to match what is there in virtio 1.0 right now: driver
does not touch any used descriptors until the used index is updated.

I don't understand this statement. All I said is that it's up to device
whether to write out the descriptors with VRING_DESC_F_MORE, or to skip
the write out.

I'm not sure what above means either.
That is exactly what above proposal says: device simply writes out a single
descriptor. Driver has to keep track and know where the next one will be
written.

Example

Driver writes two pairs chained with MORE: 0 + 1, 2 + 3
Device writes: 0 and 3
