Peter, I am sorry that I have focused recently on making the qspinlock 
patch works with virtualization and it is easier for me to based off on 
my patch initially. Now the PV part is almost done, I will apply them on 
top of your patch. Hopefully, I will get a new patch out sometime next week.

I am really sorry if you have bad feeling about it. I do not mean to 
discredit you on your effort to make the qspinlock patch better. I 
really appreciate your input and would like to work with you on this 
patch as well as other future patches.

-Longman
