In the case of kvm tools and qemu for example, the hypervisor doesn't
need to be 'prepared' for it.

When the balloon if inflated, the pages are madvise(MADV_DONTNEED),
which means that we can access those pages immediately when deflating
without having to do anything special to prepare for it.

I'm not saying that speed is critical here, I'm just saying that the
feature was added to the spec for a reason - to prevent unnecessary
overhead like in the case of kvm tools and qemu, and we just choose to
ignore it completely.

No, the host is not doing anything wrong by not processing deflate vq.

This just leads me to believe that we should either not notify the host,
or not wait_for_completion() when telling the host.
