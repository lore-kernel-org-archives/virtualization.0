I didn't know it's in already, might be interesting adding support to it
to x86 userspace tools.

I thought you used the 'legacy' layout, which is why I was worried that
these changed might cause problems for you - but from what I see you
have a different layout there, so as you said, it shouldn't cause any
issues there.
