Right, that question is still open, and dont't see it as very important
right now, as long as we can still use it for VEPA.

Not yet, but I guess it comes as a natural extension when I fix
multicast/broadcast delivery from the reflective relay for VEPA.

The logic that I would use there is:

broadcast from a dowstream port:
     if (bridge_mode(source_port)) {
          forward_to_upstream(frame);
          for_each_downstream(port) {
                /* deliver to all bridge ports except self, do
                   not deliver to any VEPA port. */
                if (bridge_mode(port) && port != source_port) {
                       forward_to_downstream(frame, port);
                }
          }
     } else {
          forward_to_upstream(frame);
     }


broadcast from the upstream port
     if (bridge_mode(frame.source)) {
          /* comes from a port in bridge mode, so has already been
             delivered to all other bridge ports */
          for_each_downstream(port) {
                if (!bridge_mode(port)) {
                         forward_to_downstream(frame, port);
                }
          }
     } else if (vepa_mode(frame.source)) {
          /* comes from VEPA port, so need to deliver to all
             bridge and all vepa ports except self */
          for_each_downstream(port) {
                if (port != frame.source)
                       forward_to_downstream(frame, port);
     } else {
          /* external source, so flood to everyone */
          for_each_downstream(port) {
                forward_to_downstream(frame, port);
     }

For multicast, we can do the same, or optionally add a per-port filter
as you mentioned, if it becomes a bottleneck. 

Do you think this addresses the problem, or did I miss something important?

If you want to use tcpdump or wireshark on all ports simulateously in a pure
VEPA, you can still attach it to the 'lowerdev', e.g. eth0 or eth0.2 (for macvlan
nested in vlan).
If we allow bridge ports, we might want to extend the local delivery
to also go through all the hooks of the external port, so that you can
attach packet sockets there.

Not sure what you mean. Are you talking about a firewall separating the guests
from the outside, between the VEPA and the reflective relay, or a firewall between
the guests in case of local delivery?
