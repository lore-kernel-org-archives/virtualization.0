Then why don't you use it here?

I still think there's a real problem somewhere else in the architecture
if such a sleep is necessary...

Is the issue that the modprobe of the hv_vmbus can return before the bus
is really all set up and ready to go?  If so, just fix that, then you
will not need any "sleep" calls anywhere, right?
