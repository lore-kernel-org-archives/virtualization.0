I agree that performance results for this need to be shown.

My original point is really that it's not a good idea to take
individual steps without a good big picture because this will change
the virtio-net device specification.  If this turns out to be a dead
end then hosts will need to continue to support the interface forever
(legacy guests could still try to use it).  So please first explain
what the full stack picture is going to look like and how you think it
will lead to better performance.  You don't need to have all the code
or evidence, but just enough explanation so we see where this is all
going.
