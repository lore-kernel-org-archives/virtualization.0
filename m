That's not going to work so well as you need to increase the ring
size by MAX_SKB_FRAGS times to achieve the same level of effect.

Basically the current scheme is either going to suck at non-TSO
traffic or it's going to chew too much resources.

That's fine but having skb->data in the ring still means two
different kinds of memory in there and it sucks when you only
have 1500-byte packets.

That's not really the key problem here.  The problem here is
that the scheme we're currently using in virtio-net is simply
broken when it comes to 1500-byte sized packets.  Most of the
entries on the ring buffer go to waste.

We need a scheme that handles both 1500-byte packets as well
as 64K-byte size ones, and without holding down 16M of memory
per guest.

Sure that sounds reasonable.

No we don't.  kmap would only be necessary for highmem which we
did not request.
