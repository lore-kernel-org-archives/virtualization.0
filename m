I see, so urgent descriptor needs to be disabled in this case. But vhost
parts need a little big changes, we could not just check
VRING_AVAIL_F_NO_INTERRUPT when vq->urgent is true. If event index is
enabled, we still need to check used event to make sure the current tx
delayed interrupt works.

But just re-using VRING_AVAIL_F_NO_INTERRUPT for urgent descriptor may
not work in some case. I see codes of virtqueue_get_buf() that may
breaks this:

        /* If we expect an interrupt for the next entry, tell
host                                                                                                       

         * by writing event index and flush out the write
before                                                                                                         

         * the read in the next get_buf call. */
        if (!(vq->vring.avail->flags & VRING_AVAIL_F_NO_INTERRUPT)) {
                vring_used_event(&vq->vring) = vq->last_used_idx;
                virtio_mb(vq->weak_barriers);
        }

Consider if only urgent descriptor is enabled, this will publish used
event which in fact enable lots of unnecessary interrupt. In fact I
don't quite understand how the above lines is used. Virtio-net stop the
queue before enable the tx interrupt in start_xmit(), so the above lines
will not run at all.

Ok.
