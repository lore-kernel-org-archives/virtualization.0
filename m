&gt;Thanks very much for the testing. So on the first glance<BR>
&gt;one seems to see a significant performance gain in V0 here,<BR>
&gt;and a slightly less significant in V2, with V1<BR>

&gt;Some comments on the results: I found out that V0 because of mistake<BR=

&gt;I pushed out virtio-net-limit-xmit-polling/v1a instead that<BR>
&gt;actually does what I intended to check. However,<BR>
&gt;the fact we get such a huge distribution in the results by Tom<BR>
&gt;most likely means that the noise factor is very large.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;From my experience one way to get stable results is to<BR>
&gt;divide the throughput by the host CPU utilization<BR>
&gt;(measured by something like mpstat).<BR>
&gt;Sometimes throughput doesn't increase (e.g. guest-host)<BR>

&gt;Without arguing about whether these are practically interesting<BR>
&gt;workloads, these results are thus unlikely to be significantly affected=
<BR>
&gt;by the optimization in question.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;What we are interested in, thus, is either TCP_RR with a -b flag<BR>
