Why woud real devices use new vendor/device IDs ? Also there are other
cases such as using virtio between 2 partitions, which we could do
under PowerVM ... that would require proper iommu usage with existing
IDs.

The only way that works forward for me (and possibly sparc & others,
what about ARM ?) is if we *change* something in virtio qemu at the
same time as we add some kind of property. For example the ProgIf field
or revision ID field.

That way I can key on that change.

It's still tricky because I would have to somewhat tell my various firmwares
(SLOF, OpenBIOS, OPAL, ...) so they can create the appropriate property, it's
still hacky, but it would be workable.

Ben.
