Hi Michael,

        I'm a bit confused about why ubuf_info and heads are UIO_MAXIOV
length arrays, rather than being the size of the ring?  In particular,
this is suspicious:

linux/drivers/vhost/net.c:342:	struct ubuf_info *ubuf = &vq->ubuf_info[head];

And it seems to assume we trust head: a malicious guest could put the
same head entry in the ring twice, and we will get two callbacks on the
same value.  I don't know what that will do, but I'm not sure it's
harmless.

Thanks,
Rusty.
