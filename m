I'm all for doing this as some kind of bus property, if needed,
although David Woodhouse may be right that the best solution is to
*always* have the IOMMU there and to just ask it for an identity map
if desired.

If I'm understanding you correctly, this won't work for Xen on QEMU.
QEMU's virtio-pci device doesn't have a real IOMMU, but it is still
behind Xen's translation layer, and QEMU doesn't even know that Xen is
there.
