It is certainly easier to deal with a small integer than with 128bit giud and there is
no added benefit dealing with guids since the number of drivers we will support
under vmbus will never exceed a very small number. Having said that, I will go ahead
and embed full guids as you have suggested. So, the aliases for these drivers will be:
vmbus:device guid.
