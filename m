Are there _many_ callers ? I don't think so. 
But okay, I don't say strong objections more if other ones say ok.

BTW, a sad information for you.
you can't call lock_page_cgroup() under radix_tree->lock.

plz update.

I don't think it's reasonable. Why I/O device, scheduler should know about
such mm-related information ? I think layering is wrong.
And your approatch cannot be a workaround.

In follwing _typical_ case,
 
  - A process does small logging to /var/log/mylog, once in a sec.
    but it uses some amount of cold memory or shmem.

This process's logging will be delayed _unexpectedly_ by some buggy process
which does memory leak.
