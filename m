Well actually it's the other way around. An iommu in theory doesn't need
to bring overhead if you set it in bypass mode.  Which does imply the
iommu supports bypass mode. Is that universally the case?  DMA API does
see Christoph's list of things it does some of which add overhead.

Seems to be :( Jason reports about 4%. I wonder whether we can support
map_sg and friends being NULL, then use that when mapping is an
identity. A conditional branch there is likely very cheap.

Would this cover all platforms with kvm (which is where we care
most about performance)?

Right so I was trying to write it up in a systematic way, but just to
give you one example, if there is a system where DMA API handles
coherency issues, or flushing of some buffers, then our PLATFORM_IOMMU
flag causes that to happen.

And we kinda worked around this without the IOMMU by basically saying
"ok we do not really need DMA API so let's just bypass it" and
it was kind of ok except now everyone is switching to vIOMMU
just in case. So now people do want some parts of what DMA API does,
such as the bounce buffer use, or IOMMU mappings.

And maybe in the end the solution is going to be to do something similar
to virt_Xmb except for DMA APIs: add APIs that handle just the
addressing bits but without the overhead. See
commit 6a65d26385bf487926a0616650927303058551e3
    asm-generic: implement virt_xxx memory barriers
for reference, it's a similar set of issues.

So it's not a problem with your patches as such, it's just that
they don't solve that harder problem.
