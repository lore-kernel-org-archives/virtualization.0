The 2 netdev model breaks a large number of expectations of user
space. Among them is XDP since we cannot guarantee a symmetric setup
between any entity and the virtio. How does it make sense that
enabling XDP on virtio shows zero Rx packets, and in the meantime you
are getting all of the packets coming in off of the VF?

In addition we would need to rewrite the VLAN and MAC address
filtering ndo operations since we likely cannot add any VLANs since in
most cases VFs are VLAN locked due to things like port VLAN and we
cannot change the MAC address since the whole bonding concept is built
around it.

The last bit is the netpoll packet routing which the current code
assumes is using the virtio only, but I don't know if that is a valid
assumption since the VF is expected to be the default route for
everything else when it is available.

The point is by the time you are done you will have rewritten pretty
much all the network device ops. With that being the case why add all
the code to virtio itself instead of just coming up with a brand new
set of ndo_ops that belong to this new device, and you could leave the
existing virtio code in place and save yourself a bunch of time by
just accessing it as an existing call as a separate netdev.

This would work well for the SwitchDev model, but not so well for the
legacy model supported by the Intel drivers. With SwitchDev the
broadcasts/multicasts are coming in on the upllink port representor
anyway is my understanding of how some of the implementations out
there are configured.

For now though we can't assume the logic in the path. We can do that
later when we start looking at v2 which would likely have us spawn a
new device that acts as some sort of smart PCI bridge/PCIe switch that
can then have that device assigned to the virtio-bond/bridge and can
hopefully start taking care of things like providing topology/switch
information and maybe incorporate some DMA tracking on the VF which
would probably be v3.

In the meantime for now I would say we keep this simple. We create a
virtio-bond device that does a bit of identity theft on the existing
virtio by mapping the same device, pushes the existing virtio to a
different name to hide it from udev to avoid naming confusion. We make
the device as dumb as can be and don't let it do any L2 configuration
such as assigning a MAC address or VLAN filter, we could probably flag
it as VLAN challenged. The XDP problem solves itself by us not
exposing any bpf or XDP operations. Then all that is left is dealing
with netpoll which if needed we can probably borrow the existing
approach from the bonding driver to solve.

Anyway that is the direction I see this going in.

Thanks.
