No; it's up to the caller to make sure that they are serialized.  In the case 
of tun that happens naturally.

There are two reasons not to grab the lock.  It turns out that if we tried to 
lock here, we'd deadlock, since the callbacks are called under the lock.  
Secondly, it's possible to implement an atomic vring_used_buffer variant, 
which could fail: this would avoid using the thread most of the time.

Hope that helps,
Rusty.
