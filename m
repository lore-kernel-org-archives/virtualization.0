It seems more complicated to me for hardly any reason.  (Besides, is it
cheaper?  It has one less memory barrier on some architectures I frankly
do not care much about---not on x86---but it also has two memory
accesses instead of one on all architectures).

Not so sure, consider the previous example with last_processor_id equal
to 1.

    queuecommand on CPU #0         queuecommand #2 on CPU #1
  --------------------------------------------------------------
    atomic_inc_return(...) == 1
                                   atomic_inc_return(...) == 2
                                   virtscsi_queuecommand to queue #1
    last_processor_id == 0? no
    spin_lock
    tgt->req_vq = queue #0
    spin_unlock
    virtscsi_queuecommand to queue #0

This is not a network driver, there are still a lot of locks around.
This micro-optimization doesn't pay enough for the pain.

Because tgt->reqs will never become zero (which is a necessary condition
for tgt->req_vq to change), as long as one request is executing
virtscsi_queuecommand.
