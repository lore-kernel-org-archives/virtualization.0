That should not be an issue for patches that are being submitted, right?

And if this is the case, shouldn't it be called out in the changelog
entry?

Just always declare it in your driver, which will be added _after_ this
field gets added to the kernel tree as well.  It's not a big deal, just
an ordering of patches issue.

Because remember, don't add #ifdefs to drivers, they should not be
needed at all.
