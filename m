Yes, no known issues with vt-d emulation for almost a year now. Error
reporting could be improved, and interrupt remapping is still missing,
but those are minor issues in this context.

In my testing setups, I also have virtio devices in use, passed through
to an L2 guest, but only in 1:1 mapping so that their broken IOMMU
support causes no practical problems.
