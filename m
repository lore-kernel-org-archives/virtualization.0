As I look at the git log in today's tree,
the topmost patch of mine that is applied is:

Staging: hv: Get rid of blkvsc_check_events()

This is a patch that is not even in the patch-set that you were currently
applying. On April 6th, I sent three patch-sets (all these 3 were resends
after the tree opened):

0000-Staging-hv-Cleanup-storage-drivers-phase-II-fixup: This was a two patch series to
fix-up some bugs. This has been applied.

0000-Staging-hv-Cleanup-storage-drivers-phase-III: This was a 22 patch-set of 
which you applied 4 patches and the application of the fifth caused a failure
(as noted by you in this mail).

0000-Staging-hv-Cleanup-storage-drivers-phase-IV: This was a 22 patch set
That should have been applied last.

For some reason, after you applied 4 patches from the second set,
looking at the git log, it looks like a patch from the third set was
applied: 

Subject: [PATCH 01/22]  Staging: hv: Get rid of blkvsc_check_events()

This is the reason why 
[PATCH 05/22] Staging: hv: Get rid of the forward declaration of blkvsc_init_rw()
failed to apply. I am curious if I did something wrong that might have caused
this problem.

With regards to rectifying this problem, if you can roll-back that last patch
that was applied out of order, then I think everything should apply just
fine. If this is not possible, I would need to re-spin the 40 odd patches 
that currently fail to apply.

K. Y
