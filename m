Today, it's supposed to send guest physical addresses. We can make that
optional via some nego or capabilities to support more esoteric setups
but for backward compatibility, this must remain the default behaviour.

Correct, it's an original virtio implementation choice for maximum
performances.

This is a potentially a LOT slower and is backward incompatible with
current qemu/KVM and kvmtool yes.

The slowness can be alleviated using various techniques, for example on
ppc64 we can create a DMA window that contains a permanent mapping of
the entire guest space, so we could use such a thing for virtio.

Another think we could do potentially is advertize via the device-tree
that such a bus uses a direct mapping and have the guest use appropriate
"direct map" dma_ops.

But we need to keep backward compatibility with existing
guest/hypervisors so the default must remain as it is.

I am aware of that. There are also attempts at using virtio to make two
machines communicate via a PCIe link (either with one as endpoint of the
other or via a non-transparent switch).

Which is why I'm not objecting to what you are trying to do ;-)

My suggestion was that it might be a cleaner approach to do that by
having the individual virtio drivers always use the dma_map_* API, and
limiting the kludgery to a combination of virtio_pci "core" and arch
code by selecting an appropriate set of dma_map_ops, defaulting with a
"transparent" (or direct) one as our current default case (and thus
overriding the iommu ones provided by the arch).

But x86_64 is the same no ? The day it starts growing an iommu emulation
in qemu (and I've heard it's happening) it will still want to do direct
bypass for virtio for performance.

Today .... I wouldn't bet on it to remain that way. The qemu
implementation of virtio is physically addressed and you don't
necessarily have a choice of which device gets an iommu and which not.
