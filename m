Hello,

Since we still have time to introduce disruptive changes, I'm
considering changing the UNMAP parameters slightly. Behavior stays the
same, but instead of passing virt_addr and size, we pass virt_start and
virt_end:

struct virtio_iommu_req_unmap {
        le32    domain;
        le64    virt_start;
        le64    virt_end;
        le32    reserved;
};

And for symmetry, also change MAP:

struct virtio_iommu_req_map {
        le32    domain;
        le64    phys_start;
        le64    virt_start;
        le64    virt_end;
        le32    flags;
};

This would allow to express the full 64-bit range in MAP and UNMAP
requests. Currently the MAP description dismisses this case with "just
use VIRTIO_IOMMU_F_BYPASS if you need an identity mapping", and I think
it still holds. But for UNMAP it can be useful to send a single request
covering the full address space instead of lots of individual requests.

I had this problem when implementing ATTACH/DETACH in kvmtool, because
VFIO doesn't have an explicit unmap-all command (and kvmtool doesn't
keep track of the mappings). When changing a device's domain, I had to
send two unmap commands, one for each half of the address space. It's
not a huge problem, just a bit inconvenient.

I don't see how unmap-all would be useful for virtio-iommu at the moment
(since detaching the domain unmaps all) but just like it turns out to be
desirable in VFIO, I'm sure someone will need it in virtio-iommu one
day.

Alternatively we could change \field{reserved} of the unmap request into
\field{flags} and add an UNMAP_ALL flag. This is backward-compatible and
less invasive. Introducing a new UNMAP_ALL request would probably be
cleaner though. In any case, I personally prefer start and end
parameter, it looks nicer. The changeset below looks scary, but it's
mostly reformatting.

Please let me know if you have any objection, or other comment for 0.5.

Thanks,
Jean

Subject: [PATCH] Change MAP and UNMAP parameters

Passing start/end instead of start/size to MAP and UNMAP offers more
flexibility. UNMAP can now be used to unmap the whole address space in
one go. UNMAP(domain, 0, ~0ULL) should now remove all mappings.
