If one would build a real virtio device today, it would be broken
because every IOMMU would start to translate its requests. Already from
that POV, we really need to introduce a feature flag "I will be
IOMMU-translated" so that a potential physical implementation can carry
it unconditionally.

Only the current drivers are broken. And we can easily tell them apart
from newer ones via feature flags. Sorry, don't get the problem.
