Well, if the netperf is (effectively) pinned to a given CPU, presumably it would 
be trying to generate UDP datagrams at the same rate each time.  Indeed though, 
no guarantee that rate would consistently get through each time.

But then, that is where one can use the confidence intervals options to get an 
idea by how much the rate varied.
