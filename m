It works, but we may lose some chances to use clone_skb and stress the device 
and driver more. I'm thinking maybe we can turn back to my original RFC to 
introduce another flag. This flag maybe also useful for BQL and zerocopy in the 
future since both of them are sensitive to the transmit buffer completion.
