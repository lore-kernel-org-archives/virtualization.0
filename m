I think kexec bzImage loader will break. It bypasses the setup code and
directly jumps to the code present after setup sectors(decompressor).

With relocatable patches, if a boot loader decides to load protected mode
component at non-1MB address, then it shall have to modify code32_start to
reflect the new location of protected mode code.
