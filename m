Given that /sbin/kexec creates a binary blob in memory, surely the most 
simple thing is to get it to suitably mlock() the region and give a list 
of VAs to the hypervisor.

This way, Xen can properly take care of what it does with information 
and where.  For example, at the moment, allowing dom0 to choose where 
gets overwritten in the Xen crash area is a recipe for disaster if a 
crash occurs midway through loading/reloading the crash kernel.
