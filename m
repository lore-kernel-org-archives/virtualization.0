The environment where we currently run all this is z/VM as the host and
Linux as the guest. We have two page tables on s390, a host page table
and a guest page table. If the host discards a page it simple removes
the entry for the page in the host page table. If the guest comes along
and accesses the page the host gets the fault and generates the
appropriate fault.

Yes, the handler for an addressing exception will call die() for a
kernel check without a fixup.

Yes.

Well, technically you could write to a Vr page via the kernel address
space. The thing is that the host can just discard the page although it
is dirty. The Vr state is used for page cache pages which do not have
any writable mapping.
