It looks like it was a quiet cycle for vhost-net:
probably because most of energy was spent on bugfixes
that went in for 2.6.36.
People are working on multiqueue, tracing but I'm not
sure it'll get done in time for 2.6.37 - so here's
a tree with a single patch that helps windows guests
which we definitely want in the next kernel.

Please merge for 2.6.37.
Thanks!
