Xen patches were posted to xen-devel by Yu Zhao on the 29th of September [1].
Unfortunately the only responses that I can find are a) that the patches
were mangled and b) they seem to include changes (by others) that have
been merged into Linux. I have confirmed that both of these concerns
are valid.

I have not yet examined the difference, if any, in the approach taken by Yu
to SR-IOV in Linux and Xen. Unfortunately comparison is less than trivial
due to the gaping gap in kernel versions between Linux-Xen (2.6.18.8) and
Linux itself.

One approach that I was considering in order to familiarise myself with the
code was to backport the v6 Linux patches (this thread) to Linux-Xen. I made a
start on that, but again due to kernel version differences it is non-trivial.
