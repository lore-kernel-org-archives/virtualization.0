The problem space is a bit different.  My immediate concern is getting
vhost (and thus vhost_net/blk) to use vringh: I wanted to unify the
in-userspace and in-kernelspace ring implementations.  We don't have
that issue in virtqueue.c.

vhost is (will be) the higher abstraction for in-userspace rings,
perhaps we want an equivalent for in-kernelspace rings.  I'm happy to
look at patches, but I don't immediately see what it would look like...

Thanks,
Rusty.
