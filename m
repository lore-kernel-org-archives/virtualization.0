I think Sridhar and Jiri might be better person to answer it. My
impression was that sync'ing the MAC address change between all 3
devices is challenging, as the failover driver uses MAC address to
match net_device internally.

So lets say host policy explicitly requires UUID but the guest does
not support it. The guest could be a legacy guest with no STANDBY
support, or a relevately recent guest with STANDBY support but without
the UUID support. In either case, since host asked for UUID matching
explicitly, maybe because it requires different NIC using same MAC, so
it has to override the negotiation result of STANDBY, even if STANDBY
is set and supported? That will end up with inter-feature dependency
over STANDBY, as you see.
