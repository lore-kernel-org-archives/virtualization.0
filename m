That's the wrong thing to do ... you need to unwrap the error code.
The reason being I presume it's not impossible for Windows to host a
device supporting ATA_16 and there are signs that this is going to be
necessary to prevent data corruption on some USB devices ... if you just
filter the command without checking if the host supports it, you're
going to end up perpetuating the corruption problem.

The general rule of thumb for avoiding this is to let the lower layers
handle as much as possible, and only begin behaviour alterations in the
upper layers if the lower layers have a provable and usually fatal
failure.
