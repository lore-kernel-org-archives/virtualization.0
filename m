It's always read under one of many mutexes, yes.

However, it's still RCU-like in the sense that you separate the removal 
and reclamation phases so you still need rcu_dereference/rcu_assign_pointer.

With this mechanism, readers do not contend the mutexes with the 
VHOST_SET_MEMORY ioctl, except for the very short lock-and-unlock 
sequence at the end of it.  They also never contend the mutexes between 
themselves (which would be the case if VHOST_SET_MEMORY locked all the 
mutexes).

You could also wrap all virtqueue processing with a rwsem and take the 
rwsem for write in VHOST_SET_MEMORY.  That simplifies some things however:

- unnecessarily complicates the code for all users of vhost_get_vq_desc

- suppose the reader-writer lock is fair, and VHOST_SET_MEMORY places a 
writer in the queue.  Then a long-running reader R1 could still block 
another reader R2, because the writer would be served before R2.


The RCU-like approach avoids all this, which is important because of the 
generally simpler code and because VHOST_SET_MEMORY is the only vhost 
ioctl that can happen in the hot path.
