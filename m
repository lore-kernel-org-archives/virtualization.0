Yes. All inline assembly tells gcc what registers are clobbered
and it fills in the tables. Hand clobbering in inline assembly cannot
be expressed with the current toolchain, so we moved all those
out of line.

But again I'm not sure it will work anyways. For once you would
need large padding around the calls anyways for inline replacement --
how would you generate that? I expect you would need to put the calls
into asm() again and with that a custom annotiation format looks reasonable.
