Yes, that is correct.

And when you save that pointer, you ARE incrementing the reference count
properly, right?  If not, you just caused a bug.

Yes, but the "base" structure of virtio_device does not contain a lock
that the users of that priv pointer are using to control access to data
_within_ the priv pointer, right?

That's up to the users within the priv pointer.

Now I see how you were trying to move the lock "deeper" as it seemed
that everyone needed it, but you just moved the lock away from the thing
that it was trying to protect, which might cause problems, and at the
least, is confusing as heck because you are mixing two different layers
here, in ways that should not be mixed.

If you really need a lock to protect some private data within the priv
pointer, then put it somewhere else,like in the priv pointer, as almost
all other subsystems do.
