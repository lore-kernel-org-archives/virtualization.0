It's that "second" part that I'm worried about.  How is that going to
happen?  Do you have any patches that show this kind of "assignment"?

Are there any such drivers available yet?

Agreed, but what does that channel look like in Linux?

I have some ideas of what I think it should look like, but if people
already have code, I'd love to see that as well.

I totally agree, I'm arguing about what that API looks like :)

I want to see some code...
