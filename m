Here are the netdev_ops that are currently supported by virtio_net

    static const struct net_device_ops virtnet_netdev = {
             .ndo_open            = virtnet_open,
             .ndo_stop            = virtnet_close,
             .ndo_start_xmit      = start_xmit,
             .ndo_validate_addr   = eth_validate_addr,
             .ndo_set_mac_address = virtnet_set_mac_address,
             .ndo_set_rx_mode     = virtnet_set_rx_mode,
             .ndo_get_stats64     = virtnet_stats,
             .ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid = virtnet_vlan_rx_add_vid,
             .ndo_vlan_rx_kill_vid = virtnet_vlan_rx_kill_vid,
    #ifdef CONFIG_NET_POLL_CONTROLLER
             .ndo_poll_controller = virtnet_netpoll,
    #endif
             .ndo_bpf                = virtnet_xdp,
             .ndo_xdp_xmit           = virtnet_xdp_xmit,
             .ndo_xdp_flush          = virtnet_xdp_flush,
             .ndo_features_check     = passthru_features_check,
    };

Now if we want to create 2 netdevs associated with a single 
virtio_device, do we want these ops
supported by master or slave netdev? I guess these should be supported 
by the slave netdev.
So do we want the netdev_ops of master simply call the slave netdev_ops 
for most the the cases
except for the ndo_start_xmit() which will decide between virtio or vf 
datapath?

what about ethtool_ops? we need to sync up link state between master and 
slave netdevs and
the userspace needs to be aware of 2 type of virtio_net devices.

Is this complexity really required to support a feature that can only be 
supported/useful for
simple guest network configurations that can be controlled by 
hypervisor.   virtio_net device
that could be accelerated via a passthru device and support live migration.

If a guest admin needs to configure any complex network configurations 
in the guest, i think those
scenarios can be supported via bond/bridge/team setups and live 
migration may not be a requirement
for such usecases.

Thanks
Sridhar

Not sure what you meant by vlans sharing a driver with the main driver.
IIUC, vlans are supported via 802.1q driver and  creates a netdev of type
'vlan'

Just to clarify, it seems like what you are suggesting is just adding
the "master" as a separate set of netdev ops or netdevice and to have
virtio spawn two network devices, one slave and one master, if the
BACKUP bit is set. Do I have that right?

I am good with the code still living in the virtio driver and
consolidation with other similar implementations and further
improvement could probably happen later as part of some refactor.
