Hi all,

These are new releases of dm-ioband and blkio-cgroup. The major change
of these releases is that a hierarchical configuration is supported,
a parent cgroup's bandwidth is distributed to its children. The
hierarchical configuration is available when using dm-ioband and
blkio-cgroup together. Please refer to the documentation included in 
this series of patches on how to use it.

The summary of the changes are below:
dm-ioband v1.13.0
  - Introduce a hierarchical grouping mechanism for blkio-cgroup.
  - Change the dmsetup status outputs to be similar to 
    /proc/diskstats and /sys/block/dev/stat files.
blkio-cgroup v12
  - dm-ioband can be configured in a hierarchical manner through the
    cgroup interface.
  - blkio.stat file is added which shows IO statistics per cgroup.

TODO
  - Borrowing and lending bandwidth between a parent and children if
    spare bandwidth is available in them.

These patches can be applied to kernel 2.6.31

The list of the patches:
  [PATCH 1/9] I/O bandwidth controller and BIO tracking
  [PATCH 2/9] dm-ioband-1.13.0: All-in-one patch
  [PATCH 3/9] blkio-cgroup-v12: The new page_cgroup framework
  [PATCH 4/9] blkio-cgroup-v12: Refactoring io-context initialization
  [PATCH 5/9] blkio-cgroup-v12: The body of blkio-cgroup
  [PATCH 6/9] blkio-cgroup-v12: Page tracking hooks
  [PATCH 7/9] blkio-cgroup-v12: The document of blkio-cgroup
  [PATCH 8/9] blkio-cgroup-v12: Add a cgroup support to dm-ioband
  [PATCH 9/9] blkio-cgroup-v12: The document of a cgroup support for dm-ioband

About dm-ioband
  dm-ioband is an I/O bandwidth controller implemented as a
  device-mapper driver and can control bandwidth on per partition, per
  user, per process, per virtual machine (such as KVM or Xen) basis.

About blkio-cgruop
  blkio-cgroup is a block I/O tracking mechanism implemented on the
  cgroup memory subsystem. Using this feature the owners of any type
  of I/O can be determined. This allows dm-ioband to control block I/O
  bandwidth even when it is accepting delayed write requests.
  dm-ioband can find the cgroup of each request. It is also for
  possible that others working on I/O bandwidth throttling to use this
  functionality to control asynchronous I/O with a little enhancement.

Please visit our website, the patches and more information are available.

I'd like to get some feedbacks from the list. Any comments are
appreciated.

Thanks,
