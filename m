--verbose please ;-)

Making VHOST_SCSI depends on NET looks weird but this is because vhost
core depends on it. A bunch of patches are cleaning this up. Since MST
wanted do the vhost.ko split up in 3.11, plus your WIP vringh work, so I
wanted the fix for 3.10 as minimum as possible.

Other users are using memcpy_fromiovec and friends outside net. It seems
a good idea to put it in a util library. e.g.  crypto/algif_skcipher.c
which also depends on NET for it.
