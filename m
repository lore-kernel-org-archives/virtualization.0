QEMU doesn't know that Xen is running.  I can do qemu-system-x86_64
-kernel /path/to/xen (virtme-run --xen does this) or
qemu-system-x86_64 -hda disk_with_xen.img and Xen will run.

The only reason I say "PPC only" is because I don't think that other
architectures would want to choose c.

We could plausibly use paravirt tricks for this, but that gets messy,
since e.g. the KVM kernel code might not even know what QEMU wants to
do.
