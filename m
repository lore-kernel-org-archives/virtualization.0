Actually, this one is more complicated. You also need to actually enable =

hardware interrupts again if they got disabled by an interrupt actually =

occurring while the "soft-interrupt" was disabled.

But since it's all a local-cpu issue, you can do things like test =

cpu-local memory flags for whetehr that has happened or not.

So it *should* be something as simple as

	local_irq_disable()
	{
		pda.irq_enable =3D 0;
	}

	handle_interrupt()
	{
		if (!pda.irq_enable) {
			pda.irq_queued =3D 1;
			queue_interrupt();
			.. make sure we return with hardirq's now =

			   disabled: just clear IF in the pt_regs ..
			return;
		}
		.. normal ..
	}

	local_irq_enable()
	{
		pda.irq_enable =3D 1;
		barrier();
		/* Common case - nothing happened while we were fake-disabled.. */
		if (!pda.irq_queued)
			return; =


		/* Ok, actually handle the things! */
		handle_queued_irqs();

		/*
		 * And enable the hw interrupts again, they got disabled =

		 * when we were queueing stuff.. =

		 */
		hardware_sti();
	}

but I haven't really gone over it in any detail, I may have missed =

something really obvious.

Anyway, it really *should* be pretty damn simple. No need to disable =

preemption, there should be no events that can *cause* it, since all =

interrupts get headed off at the pass.. (the return-from-interrupt thng =

should already notice that it's returning to an interrupts-disabled =

section and not try to do any preemption).

What did I miss?
