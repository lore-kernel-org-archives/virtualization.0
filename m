This might be slightly different topic though,
I've been thinking where we should add hooks to track I/O reqeust.
I think the following set of hooks is enough whether we are going to
support thread based cgroup or not.

  Hook-1: called when allocating a page, where the memory controller
	  already have a hoook.
  Hook-2: called when making a page in page-cache dirty.

For anonymous pages, Hook-1 is enough to track any type of I/O request.
For pages in page-cache, Hook-1 is also enough for read I/O because
the I/O is issued just once right after allocting the page.
For write I/O requests to pages in page-cache, Hook-1 will be okay
in most cases but sometimes process in another cgroup may write
the pages. In this case, Hook-2 is needed to keep accurate to track
I/O requests.

So, it won't be hard to make bio-cgroup accurate for I/O request
tracking.

I'm off untill 28th, thank you,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
