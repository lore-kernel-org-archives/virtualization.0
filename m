Bjorn,

I disagree with this decision for several reasons:

1. Note where `hypervisor_supports_p2pdma()` is called: before
   `host_bridge_whitelist()`. This means the code ignores the hypervisor
   topology. The claim that the VM has a virtual bridge, causing
   `pci_p2pdma_whitelist()` to fail, describes exactly how P2P is expected
   to work today.

2. We are not developing an alternative solution. This is the right
   solution, and there is broad agreement that it is the only reliable
   way to enable P2P in VMs, for ALL emulation software stacks.

3. This problem has existed and been known for at least the past eight
   years, since Logan upstreamed P2P support. The claim "we need it now
   and ASAP" is not valid at all.

4. The proposed hack does not solve the P2P-in-VM problem; it only makes it work
   in some random cases. An HMAT-based solution will still be needed, even on systems
   that use this hack.

Let's get the HMAT solution merged sooner rather than later. To make that happen,
we need a coordinated effort across the industry, not hacks to work around the
problem.

Unfortunately, this patch series was not given enough time for review.

Thanks
