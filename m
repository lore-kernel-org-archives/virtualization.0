Thank you for sharing this, Lance!

Indeed, the community is making the work a great place.

Please feel free to ask any question to DAMON community and me, whenever you
get :)

I only briefly read the paper.  But it looks like DeepSeek's DAMON usage is
similar to AWS' DAMON usage [1] for their serverless service.

While I was in AWS, I proposed [2] a more advanced version called
Access/Contiguity-aware Memory Autoscaling (ACMA).  After the RFC idea v2 [2],
no progress is made so far, though.  I shortly covered it in LSFMMBPF'25 [3],
but all I mentioned was that the project is suspended.  Recently a useer has
personally reached out to me asking the status of ACMA.  It is too early stage
of the discussion to say or promise something in my humble perspective, though.
