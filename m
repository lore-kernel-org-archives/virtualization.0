No you did not. You didn't fix the ones I reported. Which is why it got =

removed, and will not get added back until there is another maintainer.

The ones I reported were all about trusting the stack contents implicitly, =

and assuming that the unwind info was there and valid. Using things like =

"__get_user()" didn't fix it, because if a WARN_ON() happened while we =

held the mm semaphore and the unwind info was bogus, it would take a =

page-fault and deadlock.

Those kinds of things are not acceptable for debugging output. If I cannot =

use WARN_ON() because I hold the MM lock and I'm afraid there might be =

kernel corruption, then something is *wrong*!

And I told you guys this. Over *months*. And you ignored me. You told me =

everything was fine. Each time, somebody else ended up reporting a hang =

where the unwinder was at fault. And since I couldn't trust the =

maintainers to fix it, removing the broken feature that only caused more =

problems than it fixed was the only option.

And you clearly *still* haven't accepted the fact that the code was buggy. =


Does anybody wonder why I wouldn't merge it back?
