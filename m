I'd *like* to imply it by the new PCI layout, but if it doesn't work
we'll add a new feature bit.

I'm resisting a feature bit, since it constrains future implementations
which could otherwise assume it.

They can use a transport feature if they need to, of course.  But
perhaps the timing with ccw will coincide with the fix, in which they
don't need to, but it might be a bit late.

Cornelia?
