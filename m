See VHOST_NET_WEIGHT in how in -net we prevent starvation
between tx and rx.

If the work offloaded is trivial in size then the gain is likely
to be marginal.

I'e no idea how to do QoS with a per cpu thread otherwise

To clarify, you would
1. do llist_del_all in handle_kick -
   the delay this adds should be trivial
2. for completion queue work on vhost thread -
   this can be as simple as waking up the regular
   kick handler

You can further reduce overhead by batching
the wakeups in 2. See my patch
vhost-net: reduce vq polling on tx zerocopy
that does this for -net.
