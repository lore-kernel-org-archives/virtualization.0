You write a userspace or kernel module to do it.  It's a few dozen lines 
of code.

virtio assumes that the number of transports will be limited and 
interesting growth is in the number of device classes and drivers.  So 
we have support for just three transports, but 6 device classes (9p, 
rng, balloon, console, blk, net) and 8 drivers (the preceding 6 for 
linux, plus blk/net for Windows).  It would have nice to be able to 
write a new binding in Visual Basic but it's hardly a killer feature.

Well, for Ira the major issue is probably inclusion in the upstream kernel.

No, they don't.  New buses are added through industry consortiums these 
days.  No one adds a bus that is only available with their machine, not 
even Apple.

Devices/drivers are a different matter, and if you have a virtio-net 
device you'll get the same "?" until you load the driver.  That's how 
people and the OS vendors expect things to work.

That's not datapath stuff.

Ira has to implement virtio's ->kick() function and come up with 
something for discovery.  It's a lot less lines of code than there are 
messages in this thread.

Ah, okay.  I have no interest in Ira choosing either virtio or vbus.

signal and memory configuration/routing are not data-path stuff.

No.  We expose a mix of emulated-in-userspace and emulated-in-the-kernel 
devices on one bus.  Devices emulated in userspace only lose by having 
the bus emulated in the kernel.  Devices in the kernel gain nothing from 
having the bus emulated in the kernel.  It's a complete slow path so it 
belongs in userspace where state is easy to get at, development is 
faster, and bugs are cheaper to fix.
