You can't assume that vhost-* is used only along with qemu/kvm. Just as
virtio has more uses than just virtualization (heres one:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/10/25/139 ), there are more uses for vhost as
well.

There has been a great deal of effort to keep vhost and kvm untangled.
One example is the memory translation it has to do, another one is the
eventfd/irqfd thing it does just so it could signal an IRQ in the guest
instead of accessing the guest directly.

If you do see a great performance increase when tying vhost and KVM
together, it may be worth it to create some sort of an in-kernel
vhost-kvm bridging thing, but if the performance isn't noticeable we're
better off just leaving it as is and keeping the vhost code general.
