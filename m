We had implemented our custom MIC vring host access logic before the
VRINGH infrastructure was merged to mainline in v3.10. Based on your
feedback, we have a proof of concept implemented this week, by reusing
the VRINGH infrastructure and it works nicely for us!

One of our goals is to issue the  buffer transfers using DMA with future
patches. The CPU copy in our current patches is also slightly different
compared to VRINGH since we are copying from card buffers to user space
and vice versa. In order to do meet these goals, we are obtaining the
next available descriptor via vringh_getdesc_kern(..), then triggering
the copy (CPU or eventually DMA) via a custom MIC API and then
publishing the descriptor via vringh_complete_kern(..). Are there any
plans of enhancing VRINGH to allow overriding the xfer mechanism in
vringh_iov_xfer(..)? This will allow drivers with custom xfer routines
to reuse APIs like vringh_iov_push_kern(..) and vringh_iov_pull_kern(..)
as well. That said, the existing VRINGH infrastructure is generic enough
for our use case as is today.

We will post a rev1 of the patch series using VRINGH after some more
validation which should automatically address most of your other
feedback. Thanks for the review!

There are similar discussions around write combining and PCIe posted
writes @ [1] and [2]. For now, I am adding the (slow) read in the next
revision of the patch series here since that is guaranteed to work
correctly. Please let us know if there is any other way to ensure that
the previous PCIe posted writes have completed, (if we map card memory
as write combined from the host) without a PCIe read from the card.
