I think we need to cover both the scenarios here, virtualization and  
non virtualization. In the absence of virtualization, the VF and PF  
driver should be identical. In this context, how does the PF driver  
allocates a VF? Is dynamic allocation of VFs possible, or does it have  
to allocate all the VFs that the device supports when the PF driver  
loads? Also, will the probe function be called for the VFs, or does  
the PF driver handle only the probe for the physical function? In  
virtualization context things get bit more complex as the the VF  
driver in guest would like to treat the VF as a physical function but  
that may not be possible from the device perspective as the control  
registers may well be shared between VF and PF.
I would think that the VF allocation is the job of SR PCIM. PCIM may  
well ask the PF driver to configure a VF upon user request.

Thanks much,
