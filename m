Michael,
We are very interested in your patch and want to have a try with it.
I have collected your 3 patches in kernel side and 4 patches in queue side.
The patches are listed here:

PATCHv5-1-3-mm-export-use_mm-unuse_mm-to-modules.patch
PATCHv5-2-3-mm-reduce-atomic-use-on-use_mm-fast-path.patch
PATCHv5-3-3-vhost_net-a-kernel-level-virtio-server.patch

PATCHv3-1-4-qemu-kvm-move-virtio-pci[1].o-to-near-pci.o.patch
PATCHv3-2-4-virtio-move-features-to-an-inline-function.patch
PATCHv3-3-4-qemu-kvm-vhost-net-implementation.patch
PATCHv3-4-4-qemu-kvm-add-compat-eventfd.patch

I applied the kernel patches on v2.6.31-rc4 and the qemu patches on latest kvm qemu.
But seems there are some patches are needed at least irqfd and ioeventfd patches on
current qemu. I cannot create a kvm guest with "-net nic,model=virtio,vhost=vethX".

May you kindly advice us the patch lists all exactly to make it work?
Thanks a lot. :-)

Thanks
Xiaohui

Because with virtio ring can give us arbitrary guest addresses.  If
guest was limited to using a subset of addresses, hypervisor would only
have to map these.

Maybe.

Yes, it might even give some performance benefit with e.g. I/O AT.

Yes, I'm working on it.
