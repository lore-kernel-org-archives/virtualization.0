Yes. There is also another little mechanism that prevent_burst_bios()
tries not to block kernel threads if possible.

Yes. But when cgroups with higher weight aren't issueing a lot of I/Os,
even a cgroup with lower weight can allocate a lot of request descriptors.

You mean each layer should have its rb-tree? Is it per device?
One lvm logical volume may probably consist from several physical
volumes, which will be shared with other logical volumes.
And some layers may split one bio into several bios.
I hardly can imagine how these structures will be.

But I guess it is a good thing that we are going to support
a general infrastructure for I/O requests.
