Hi Stefan,

For future reference, you can recreate the build by using the provided
config, running make olddefconfig and building with compiler
referenced here:
https://github.com/google/syzkaller/blob/master/docs/syzbot.md#crash-does-not-reproduce
Also syzbot has obtained the provided crash report on the provided
reproducer on a freshly-booted machine, so the reproducer worked for
it somehow. You still may have a somewhat different setup, so it won't
reproduce for you, but I have high assurance that the reproducer is
valid.

Also please don't ignore this part. It will greatly help to keep the
whole process running. Otherwise the bot won't be able to provide all
crashes it finds.

Thanks
