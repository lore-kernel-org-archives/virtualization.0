Yes. we should block changing standby device mac.

This is strange. So you had to change the standby device mac twice to
get dhcp working.

I do see NetworkManager trying to get dhcp address on standby device, but
i don't see any issue with connectivity.  To be totally transparent, we
need to only expose one netdev.

If a VF is untrusted, a VM will not able to change its MAC and moreover
in this mode we are assuming that the hypervisor has assigned the MAC and
guest is not expected to change the MAC.

For the initial implementation, i would propose not allowing the guest to
change the MAC of failover or standby dev.

Sure. that may be the best way to handle the guest changing the primary
netdev's mac.

netdev is present with the same MAC address. It allows live migration
of a VM with a direct attached VF without the need to setup a bond/team
between a VF and virtio net device in the guest.

The hypervisor needs to enable only one datapath at any time so that
packets don't get looped back to the VM over the other datapath. When a VF
is plugged, the virtio datapath link state can be marked as down. The
hypervisor needs to unplug the VF device from the guest on the source host
and reset the MAC filter of the VF to initiate failover of datapath to
virtio before starting the migration. After the migration is completed,
the destination hypervisor sets the MAC filter on the VF and plugs it back
to the guest to switch over to VF datapath.

It uses the generic failover framework that provides 2 functions to create
and destroy a master failover netdev. When STANDBY feature is enabled, an
additional netdev(failover netdev) is created that acts as a master device
and tracks the state of the 2 lower netdevs. The original virtio_net netdev
is marked as 'standby' netdev and a passthru device with the same MAC is
registered as 'primary' netdev.

This patch is based on the discussion initiated by Jesse on this thread.
