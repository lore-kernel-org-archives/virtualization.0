What about a comment explaining what this is for?

I don't think you need the #define here.

How can these macros work?  I don't think git ever expans $Rev, and in
either case I really don't get how this is supposed to work.

Please use comment formats like this:

/*

 */

(this also applies to a few other places).

All these should be inline functions.

Not used.

Please don't conditionally re-use the SCSI-layer SENSE_BUFFER_SIZE for
your on the wire packets, but define your own.  Please also give all
theses constants a VMSCSI_ or similar prefix.

Please use fixed size u8/16/32/etc types for all the on-wire defintions.

I'd also really recommend splitting the actual protocol defintion in
a header separate from the driver implementation to make it clear what
is part of the protocol and what's internal to the driver.

unused.

This seems to duplicate the CDB16GENERIC_LENGTH define used above,
please make sure you only have one #define for this constant.

For enums specifying the protocol please always use explicit values.

This always is a struct storvsc_cmd_request, and should be typed as
such.

This always points to storvsc_command_completion, so please remove the
indirect call and use it directly.

Btw, what is the reason that storvsc_cmd_request and hv_storvsc_request
are separate structures and not merged into one?  This wastes a tiny
amount of memory for the init/reset requests, but keeps the code
a lot simpler.

I'm pretty sure you defended this odd reference counting scheme last
time the discussion came up, but please write up a long comment in
the code explaning it so that the question doesn't come up again
all the time.

This should be:

	if (stor_pkt->vm_srb.cdb[0] == INQUIRY ||
	    stor_pkt->vm_srb.cdb[0] == MODE_SENSE) {

or even better use a switch statement to clarify what's going on.

Why isn't this near storvcs_probe at the end of the file given that
they logically belong together?  Also please only do the scsi_host_put
once you are fully done with it, that is after storvsc_dev_remove.

Why is storvsc_host_reset split from this function?  Also the comment
really doesn't tell us anything, I'd rather leave it away.

I really don't see how this comment adds any value over the pure
function name.

Please add defines for the vm_srb->srb_status values.

> +static bool storvsc_check_scsi_cmd(struct scsi_cmnd *scmnd)

Please call this storvsc_ignore_command or similar to make the use more
obvious.

I don't think this can ever happen given that you make sure to always
clear ->host_scribble when returning SCSI_MLQUEUE_*_BUSY.

The point of the mempool allocator is that it will never return NULL.

Either use memset for the whole structure, or set the fields that need
it to 0 explicitly, but not both.  I doubt it's more efficient to only
initialise the fields that need it.

Please use goto labels and a single error exit for unwindining on
failure.

Not a useful comment, just remove it.

Not a very useful comment, just remove it.

path is never used, so drop that argument from storvsc_get_ide_info
please.  Target is only used in the next dev_is_ide block, so please
move this call to it.

Any reason these aren't set directly in the host template?

I'd write this as an if/else block to be be more clear.

this isn't an overly useful comment.
