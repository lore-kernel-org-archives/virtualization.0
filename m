virtio-mem wants to allow to offline memory blocks of which some parts
were unplugged, especially, to later offline and remove completely
unplugged memory blocks. The important part is that PageOffline() has
to remain set until the section is offline, so these pages will never
get accessed (e.g., when dumping). The pages should not be handed
back to the buddy (which would require clearing PageOffline() and
result in issues if offlining fails and the pages are suddenly in the
buddy).

Let's allow to do that by allowing to isolate any PageOffline() page
when offlining. This way, we can reach the memory hotplug notifier
MEM_GOING_OFFLINE, where the driver can signal that he is fine with
offlining this page by dropping its reference count. PageOffline() pages
with a reference count of 0 can then be skipped when offlining the
pages (like if they were free, however they are not in the buddy).

Anybody who uses PageOffline() pages and does not agree to offline them
(e.g., Hyper-V balloon, XEN balloon, VMWare balloon for 2MB pages) will not
decrement the reference count and make offlining fail when trying to
migrate such an unmovable page. So there should be no observerable change.
Same applies to balloon compaction users (movable PageOffline() pages), the
pages will simply be migrated.

Note 1: If offlining fails, a driver has to increment the reference
	count again in MEM_CANCEL_OFFLINE.

Note 2: A driver that makes use of this has to be aware that re-onlining
	the memory block has to be handled by hooking into onlining code
	(online_page_callback_t), resetting the page PageOffline() and
	not giving them to the buddy.

Michal,

this is the approach where we allow has_unmovable_pages() to succeed to
reach MEM_GOING_OFFLINE and fail later in case the driver did not agree.

Thoughts?
