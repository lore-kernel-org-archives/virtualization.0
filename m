(s/ndo_close/ndo_stop/)

You don't think we should do any refills on a closed device?  If so, we
simply move the refill-stop code into ndo_stop (aka virtnet_close), and
the refill-start code into ndo_open (aka. virtnet_open).  Right?

Orthogonally, the refill-stop code is still buggy, as you noted.  And
for self-rearming timers the pattern I've always used is a flag.

Or am I being obtuse again? :)
Rusty.
