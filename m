So all the documentation I see in the VMCI Socket Programming Guide is about
userspace programming, and the documentation in af_vsock.c is all around
implementation considerations.

Is there anything that documents the actual protocol? Just for example, whats
the deal with REQUEST/REQUEST2? it appears like something to deal with legacy
code, but I'd really like to have it documented somewhere instead of trying
to figure how everything works by looking at the code.


Thanks,
Sasha
