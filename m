You could specify VF MAC and VLANs using netlink today.
e.g. ip link set ethX vf # mac, vlan etc.
Adding spoofing as follows would do it.
ip link set ethX vf # spoof on|off 

Having SR-IOV features scattered among ethtool and ip link may be inconvenient for the end users.

I could take a stab at it at the netlink side, if there is a consensus.
