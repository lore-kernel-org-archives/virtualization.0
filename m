My question here is if RDMA works on any non-coherent DMA systems? If 
not then it should fail early (during init or probe?) to avoid potential 
data corruption and new DMA attributes won't help it. On the other hand, 
theDMA_ATTR_CPU_CACHE_OVERLAP attribute is a bit more descriptive to me 
than DMA_ATTR_CPU_CACHE_CLEAN, but this indeed looks like a separate 
issue from the RDMA case.
