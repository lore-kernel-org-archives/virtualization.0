Maybe just document this?

I still believe capacity really needs to be decided
at the virtqueue level, not in the driver.
E.g. with indirect each skb uses a single entry: freeing
1 small skb is always enough to have space for a large one.

I do understand how it seems a waste to leave direct space
in the ring while we might in practice have space
due to indirect. Didn't come up with a nice way to
solve this yet - but 'no worse than now :)'

Maybe I'm confused here.  The problem isn't the failing
add_buf for the given skb IIUC.  What we are trying to do here is stop
the queue *before xmit_skb fails*. We can't look at the
number of fragments in the current skb - the next one can be
much larger.  That's why we check capacity after xmit_skb,
not before it, right?
