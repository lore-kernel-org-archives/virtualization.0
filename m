Okay. I'll do the move in a separate patch to simplify review.

I'll test that. Delaying wake-up longer than necessary can cause
queue build up at the qdisc and higher tail latency, I imagine. But
it may reduce the number of __netif_schedule calls.

Yes, that sounds good. I did test that previously and saw no
difference then. But when multiple cpus contend for a single
txq it should help.
