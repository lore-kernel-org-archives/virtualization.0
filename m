Agree.

True. Do you think this rename should just be limited to what type
/sys/firmware/memmap/ emits? I have the concern, but no proof
currently, that there are /proc/iomem walkers that explicitly look for
"System RAM", but might be thrown off by "System RAM (driver
managed)". I was not aware of /sys/firmware/memmap until about 5
minutes ago.
