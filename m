Wait, I vaguely recall you seemed to like to generalize this feature
to non-PCI device. But now you're saying it should stick to PCI. It's
not that I'm reluctant with sticking to PCI. The fact is that I don't
think we can go with implementation until the semantics of the
so-called _F_STANDBY feature can be clearly defined into the spec.
Previously the boundary of using MAC address as the identifier for
bonding was quite confusing to me. And now PCI adds to the matrix.
However it still does not gurantee uniqueness I think. It's almost
incorrect of choosing MAC address as the ID in the beginning since
that has the implication of breaking existing configs. I don't think
libvirt or QEMU today retricts the MAC address to be unique per VM
instance. Neither the virtio spec mentions that.

In addition, it's difficult to fake PCI device on Linux does not mean
the same applies to other OSes that is going to implement this VirtIO
feature. It's a fragile assumption IMHO.

I know it's not ideal but perhaps its the best one can do in the KVM
world without adding complex config e.g. PCI bridge. Even if bus
number is guest specified, it's readily available in the guest and
recognizable by any OS, while on the QEMU configuration users specify
an id instead of the bus number. Unlike Hyper-V PCI bus, I don't think
there exists a para-virtual PCI bus in QEMU backend to expose VPD
capability to a passthrough device.

While it may work, the PCI bridge has NUMA and IOMMU implications that
would restrict the current flexibility to group devices. I'm not sure
if vIOMMU would have to be introduced inadvertently for
isolation/protection of devices under the PCI bridge which may cause
negative performance impact on the VF.

I'm not an expert on that and wonder how you could do this (add a
virtual VPD capability with a UUID to passthrough device) with
existing QEMU emulation model and native PCI bus.

Stephen might know it more and can correct me. But my personal
interpretation is that the SN is a host generated 32 bit sequence
number which is unique per VM instance and gets propogated to guest
via the para-virtual Hyper-V PCI bus.
