They are all supposed to use sk_receive_queue.lock I think.

It's mostly useless: code that is called after this
 does skb_peek and checks the result under the spinlock.
This was supposed to be an optimization: quickly check
that queue is not empty before we bother disabling notifications
etc, but I dont' remember at this point whether it actually gives any g=
ain.
Thanks for pointing this out, I'll take it out I think (below).
Note: there are two places of this call in upstream: handle_rx_bug and
handle_rx_mergeable, but they are merged into a single
handle_rx by a patch by Jason Wang.
The below patch is on top.
If you like to look at the latest code,
it's here master.kernel.org:/home/mst/pub/vhost.git
branch vhost-net-next has it all.

Eric, thanks very much for pointing out these.
Is there anything else that you see in this driver?


Thanks!


    vhost-net: remove unlocked use of receive_queue
   =20
    Use of skb_queue_empty(&sock->sk->sk_receive_queue)
    without taking the sk_receive_queue.lock is unsafe
    or useless. Take it out.
