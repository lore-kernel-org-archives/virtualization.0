I think the point was to avoid resets across xdp attach/detach.  If we
are doing resets now, we could do whatever buffering we want. We could
also just disable mergeable buffers for that matter.

Right but I was wondering about the fact that this makes XDP_PASS
much slower than processing skbs without XDP, as truesize is huge
so we'll quickly run out of rmem space.

When XDP is used to fight DOS attacks, why isn't this a concern?
