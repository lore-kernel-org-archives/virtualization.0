What if at VIRTIO_GPU_CMD_RESOURCE_CREATE_2D time we created a ivshmem 
device to back that resource. The ivshmem device would in turn be backed 
by a hostmem device that wraps a shmem FD.

The guest client can then export that resource/BO and pass the FD to the 
guest proxy. The guest proxy would import it and put the resource_id in 
the equivalent message in our protocol extension.

QEMU would get that resource id from vsock, look up which hostmem device 
is associated with that resource, and pass its FD to the compositor.

Not sure if that would be much simpler than creating a ivshmem+hostmem 
combo that wraps the incoming shmem FD and then having virtio-gpu create 
a BO that imports it.
