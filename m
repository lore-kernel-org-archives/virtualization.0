I think proper accounting and queueing (at all levels, not just TCP
sockets) is more important than trying to skim a bunch of cycles by
avoiding TX interrupts.

Having an event to free the SKB is absolutely essential for the stack
to operate correctly.

And with virtio-net you don't even have the excuse of "the HW
unfortunately doesn't have an appropriate TX event."

So please don't play games, and instead use TX interrupts all the
time.  You can mitigate them in various ways, but don't turn them on
selectively based upon traffic type, that's terrible.

You can even use ->xmit_more to defer the TX interrupt indication to
the final TX packet in the chain.
