Haven't measured this. But consider both methods are O(logN), should be
no noticeable difference. Will measure it in the future.

The main user is for the device IOTLB API[1], which:

- have thousands of userspace memory region sections
- may dynamically adding or removing one or some of the regions
- need a replacement algorithm like LRU
