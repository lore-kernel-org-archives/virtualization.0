This is because my qemu implementation on multi vq only uses
single iothread to handle requests from all vqs, and the only iothread
is already at full load now, that said on host side the
same fio test(single job) results is ~200K iops too.

Thanks a lot.

That is great if this can be merged to 3.17.
