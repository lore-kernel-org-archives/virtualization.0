David,
This is an amended pull request: I have rebased the tree to the
correct patches. This has been through basic tests and seems
to work fine here.

The following tree includes a couple of enhancements that help vhost-net.
Please pull them for net-next. Another set of patches is under
debugging/testing and I hope to get them ready in time for 2.6.35,
so there may be another pull request later.

Thanks!
