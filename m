I haven't looked at your patches yet - they make the virtio PCI driver
in Linux IOMMU-compatible? Perfect - except for a compatibility check,
right?

I don't see right now how critical such a hypothetical case could be.
But the OS / its drivers could still decide to refuse talking to such a
device.

I would have no problem with rejecting configurations in future QEMU
that try to expose unconfined virtio devices in the presence of IOMMU
emulation. Once we can do better, it's just about letting the guest know
about the difference.

The current situation is indeed just broken, we don't need to discuss
this as we can't change history to prevent this.

No. In that case, the feature negotiation of "virtio-with-iommu-support"
would have failed for older drivers, and the device would have never
been used by the guest.

I don't see a point in doing anything about old QEMU with IOMMU enabled
and virtio devices plugged except declaring such setups broken. No one
should have configured this for production purposes, only for test
setups (like we, with the knowledge about the limitations).

See above, the latter is only problematic on setups that actually use an
IOMMU. If that includes Xen, then no one should use it until virtio can
declare itself IOMMU compatible, and drivers exist that process this.
