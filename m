dom0 at boot gets some info about kexec/kdump configuration from Xen hypervisor
(e.g. placement of crash kernel area). Later if you call kexec syscall most
things are done in the same way as on baremetal. However, after placing image
in memory, HYPERVISOR_kexec_op() hypercall must be called to inform hypervisor
that image is loaded (new hook machine_kexec_load is used for this;
machine_kexec_unload is used for unload). Then Xen establishes fixmap for pages
found in page_list[] and returns control to dom0. If dom0 crashes or "kexec execute"
is used by user then dom0 calls HYPERVISOR_kexec_op() to instruct hypervisor that
kexec/kdump image should be executed immediately. Xen calls relocate_kernel()
and all things runs as usual.

Hmmm... Well, problem with above mentioned functions is that they work
on physical addresses. In Xen PVOPS (currently dom0 is PVOPS) they
are useless in kexec/kdump case. It means that physical addresses
must be converted to/from machine addresses which has a real meaning
in Xen PVOPS case. That is why those funtions were introduced.

I agree. I could remove all machine_* hooks from kexec_ops and call Xen
specific functions from arch files. However, I need to add two new
machine calls, machine_kexec_load and machine_kexec_unload, in the same
manner as existing machine_* calls. In general they could be used to inform
firmware (in this case Xen) that kexec/kdump image is loaded.

kimage_alloc_pages, kimage_free_pages, page_to_pfn, pfn_to_page, virt_to_phys
and phys_to_virt are worse. If we could not find good solution how to replace
them then we end up with calling Xen specific version of kexec/kdump which
would contain nearly full copy of exisiting kexec/kdump code. Not good.

We could add some code to kernel/kexec.c which depends on CONFIG_XEN.
It could contain above mentioned functions which later will be called
by existing kexec code. This is not nice to be honest. However, I hope
that we could find better solution for that problem.
