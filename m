The problem is if vq->urgent is true, the patch checks
VRING_AVAIL_F_NO_INTERRUPT bit. This bit were set unconditionally in
virtqueue_enable_cb() regardless of event index feature and cleared
unconditionally in virtqueue_disable_cb(). So virtqueue_enable_cb() was
used to not only publish a new event index but also enable the urgent
descriptor. And virtqueue_disable_cb() disabled all interrupts including
the urgent descriptor. Guest won't get urgent interrupts by just adding
virtqueue_add_outbuf_urgent() since what it needs is to enable and
disable interrupt for !urgent descriptor.

Btw, not sure "urgent" is a suitable name, since interrupt is often slow
in kvm guest. And in fact virtio-net will probably use "urgent"
descriptor for those packets (e.g stream packets who can be delayed a
little bit to batch more bytes from userspace) who was not urgent
compared to other packets.
