So that's where I'm not sure things are "good enough" due to how
pseries works. (remember it's paravirtualized).

A pseries system starts with a default iommu on all devices, that uses
translation using 4k entires with a "pinhole" window (usually 2G with
qemu iirc). There's no "pass through" by default.

Qemu virtio bypasses that iommu when the VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM flag
is not set (default) but there's nothing in the device-tree to tell the
guest about this since it's a violation of our pseries architecture, so
we just rely on Linux virtio "knowing" that it happens. It's a bit
yucky but that's now history...

Essentially pseries "architecturally" does not have the concept of not
having an iommu in the way and qemu violates that architecture today.

(Remember it comes from pHyp, our priorietary HV, which we are somewhat
mimmicing here).

So if we always set VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM, it *will* force all virtio
through that iommu and performance will suffer (esp vhost I suspect),
especially since adding/removing translations in the iommu is a
hypercall.

Now, we do have HV APIs to create a second window that's "permanently
mapped" to the guest memory, thus avoiding dynamic map/unmaps, and
Linux can make use of this but I don't know if that works with qemu and
the performance impact with vhost.

So the situation isn't that great.... On the other hand, I think the
other approach works for us:

I would assume that arch_virtio_wants_dma_ops() only returns true when
no such offsets are involved, at least in our case that would be what
happens.

For us a "bus address" is behind the iommu so that's what
VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM does already. We don't have the concept of a
bus address that is different. I suppose it's an ARMism to have DMA
offsets that are separate from iommus ?

Not on pseries, at least not in any way I can think of mind you... but
maybe other architectures would abuse it... We could add a WARN_ON if
that calls returns true on a bus with an offset I suppose.

Cheers,
Ben.
