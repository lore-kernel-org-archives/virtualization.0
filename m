After some discussion at KS, no one came up with an example where it's
necessary, and the patches to convert virtqueue to use the DMA API are
much nicer when they convert it unconditionally.

The two interesting cases we thought of were PPC and x86's emulated
Q35 IOMMU.  PPC will look in to architecting a devicetree-based way to
indicate passthrough status and will add quirks for the existing
virtio devices.  Everyone seems to agree that x86's emulated Q35 thing
is just buggy right now and should be taught to use the existing ACPI
mechanism for enumerating passthrough devices.

I'll send a new version of the series soon.
