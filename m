Could be but it's also possible that something has queued something
after the last flush?  Is the problem reproducible?

Hmmm... vhost_poll_flush() becomes synchronize_srcu_expedited().  Can
you please explain how it works?  synchronize_srcu_expedited() is an
extremely heavy operation involving scheduling the cpu_stop task on
all cpus.  I'm not quite sure whether doing it from every flush is a
good idea.  Is flush supposed to be a very rare operation?

Having custom implementation is fine too but let's try to implement
something generic if at all possible.

Thanks.
