OK, what I've found was;
 - The functions which can be ftraced look good.
   (see tracing/available_filter_functions)
 - following functions should not be able to be probed.
   - memcpy, memset
   - native_load_sp0 and some other native functions (need to be clear)
   - restore
   - trace_graph_return
   - trace_hardirqs_off_thunk, trace_hardirqs_on_thunk
   - This list still be not perfect. I just enabled/disabled kprobes
     one by one. There might be combined bugs (combination of several
     kprobes).
 - Some of them are hard to specify by NOKPROBE_SYMBOL because they are
   defined in assembly file.

Anyway, to fix all of them, I think we need file-based blacklist
especially for assembler symbols.

For example, we can get all text symbols by below command;
 nm some-file.o | grep -i " t " | cut -f3 -d" "
so that we can make a blacklisted-symbol list for the file.
I need to look the Kbuild for how I can do that in Makefile.

Thank you,
