I recognised that the driver he had modified was not an in-tree user so
it did not really help the review or the design. I did not think it was
very fair to ask that an in-tree GPU driver be converted when it would not
help the embedded platform of interest. Converting zram is both a useful
illustration of the aops requirements and is expected to be beneficial on
the embedded platform. Now, if a GPU driver author was willing to convert
theirs as an example then that would be useful!
