Not necessarily (hence "should report" rather than "must report"). The
device is free to return any arbitrary size that it feels will improve
performance in blk_size (say, a RAID stripe size), even if it's not
the same as the logical block size of any backing storage.

If this is the case, then it would be describing the
physical_block_exp and related fields from the VIRTIO_BLK_F_TOPOLOGY
feature, but it's referring to blk_size/VIRTIO_BLK_F_BLK_SIZE. Maybe
that's a mistake, but that's what the spec currently says (and has
said since at least the virtio-0.9.5 draft, which is the oldest one I
could dig up).

The Linux implementation that inspired the spec originally is useful
when trying to understand the context, but if a current-day
implementor has to go read Linux code to understand how to interpret
the spec, then the spec is not clear enough and needs to be improved
(I would guess we agree on this). If the spec never matched reality,
then the spec is not useful, but I don't think that's the case here.

This feature bit and its description in the spec has existed for a
long time (since before virtio 1.0), so it's likely that many more
virtio-blk implementations have been written since this part of the
spec was added than before it.

Maybe we disagree on the meaning of "addressable", then. What I assume
when I read "addressable" is "I can write the address" of such a
location (regardless of whether it's valid to submit a request using
this address). I can always write the address of the area of a
virtio-blk device that starts at an offset of 512 bytes, and that
address is always sector=3D1, even if the device advertises
blk_size=3D4096 and rejects unaligned I/O, so 512 is always the smallest
addressable unit. This is just like a CPU that has byte-addressable
memory but only allows aligned loads/stores - it's possible to write
an address like 0x123 and try to load a word from there, so that
location is addressable, even though it's not valid when trying to
load something larger than a byte from it.

I would not object to clarifying the wording, but it can't change the
meaning (if the smallest addressable unit was 4096 when blk_size=3D4096,
then sector=3D1 would mean 4096, but that's not how it works).

Rather than using wording like "smallest addressable unit", something
like "I/O request `sector` and data length must be a multiple of
`blk_size`" would accurately describe what you are trying to say (I
think), but this is still a breaking change in my opinion.

In theory, such a change could be introduced as a requirement tied to
a new feature bit (if the device advertises it and the driver acks it,
then I/O requests must be aligned, or something like that), but since
it would be a new, optional feature, I don't know how useful it would
be.

For normal block devices that speak ATA or SCSI or NVMe command sets,
yes, I agree - but this is not how virtio-blk was defined. And again,
I agree that it was probably a mistake to define virtio-blk in a way
that is different from all other normal block device command sets, but
that's the way it has been described in the spec since at least 2012.

Yes, it is exactly this backward compatibility that I'm concerned with
- old drivers (or drivers that ignore blk_size, which they are clearly
allowed to do per my reading of the spec) must still work correctly
with devices written against new versions of the spec.

I don't understand how it would be impossible; inconvenient, sure, but
definitely possible.

If a device receives a VIRTIO_BLK_T_IN request that is not aligned to
its preferred blk_size, it can read the minimum blk_size-aligned
region around the request into an intermediate buffer and copy only
the requested parts into the virtio buffer.

If a device receives a VIRTIO_BLK_T_OUT request that is not aligned to
its preferred blk_size, it can read the aligned region into a
temporary buffer (as before), copy the data from the virtio buffer on
top, and perform the aligned write.

If a device implementation can't afford to buffer data (such as a
hardware device with minimal on-board memory), then maybe it would be
reasonable for that device implementation to choose to return an error
for unaligned I/O, but it must not fail in a way that would cause
undefined behavior like corrupting parts of the disk.

In the case of SCSI or whatever, absolutely.

virtio-blk doesn't have a concept of logical block size today, only
the existing blk_size field, which I argue is not necessarily
equivalent.

(I have noticed that the virtio_blk_topology fields are defined in
terms of "logical blocks", which I feel is a mistake - either these
should be described in terms of blk_size, or the blk_size field needs
to be redefined to explicitly mean "logical block size" as in your
patch.)

I agree that it would be useful to have more input from other
interested parties.

For a virtio-blk device, yes (assuming "such a device" is a virtio-blk
device implementation and we substitute blk_size for "logical block
size").

The Linux driver will always request I/O that is aligned to the
blk_size (if the device reports one), yes - but that's one driver's
choice. Other drivers (which were written against the spec, not
"whatever the Linux driver does") may operate differently.

I don't know of any real-world implementations like this, but the
point of the spec is to allow interoperability without having to know
about every implementation.

From my point of view, it would be fine to clarify a few things:
- blk_size should (not must) be the logical block size of the
underlying storage device
- data should (not must) be a multiple of blk_size for best performance

And maybe:
- devices may choose to return IOERR if a driver submits an I/O
request that does not conform to the above recommendations (but this
conflicts with the "performance"-related wording that exists now)
