No, that's not it.  Look again: the storvsc_drv.c in staging is removing
1480 lines, but in git head, this file is only 792 lines long ... is
there an alternative tree with the rest in?

The point I'm making is that the staging file you're modifying isn't the
one I see in Linus' git head, so which git tree is it in (I assume it's
somewhere waiting for the merge window)?

OK, so as I read the code, what it can't handle is fragments except at
the ends.  As long as everything always transfers in multiples of 4k,
the problem will never occur.  This means that all devices you present
need to tell the OS they have 4k sectors.  I *think* you can do this by
setting  blk_limits_io_min() in the driver ... but you'll have to test
this.  The minimum sector size gets set also in sd.c when we probe the
disk.  I think that won't override blk_limits_io_min(), but please test
(we don't have any SCSI drivers which have ever used this setting).

The way to test, is to read back the /sys/block/<dev>/queue/ settings
when presenting a 512 byte sector disk.  (And the way to activate your
bounce code would be to create a filesystem with a < PAGE_SIZE block
size).
