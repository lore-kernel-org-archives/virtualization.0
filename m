Yes, that one has obvious tie-ins to virtio's modus operandi.

I'm a bit confused here. What, exactly, ties the two devices together?
If libvirt already has the knowledge that it should manage the two as a
couple, why do we need the group id (or something else for other
architectures)? (Maybe I'm simply missing something because I'm not
that familiar with pci.)

Same question as above.

I'm not yet preferring anything, as I'm still trying to understand how
this works :) I hope we can arrive at a model that covers the use case
and that is also flexible enough to be extended to other platforms.

This actually seems to mean the opposite to me: We need to know what
the guest is doing and when, as it directly drives what we need to do
with the devices. If we switch to a visibility vs a hotplug model (see
the other mail), we might be able to handle that part within qemu.
However, I don't see how you get around needing libvirt to actually set
this up in the first place and to handle migration per se.
