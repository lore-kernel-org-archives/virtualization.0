So, just because the linux code doesn't do it differently doesn't mean
that someone else doesn't.  Since the device has to work across different
possible implementations, it needs to be generic enough.  If we simply
document the current linux practice, that may not be ideal on the future.

I was hesitant to introduce this without studying the feasibility of
doing late segmentation.
