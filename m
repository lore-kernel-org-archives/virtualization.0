Hi Eric,

This initial value, that you do not really want to use, will slowly fade, but it
will still pretty much dominate the returned value for the first RECEIVE_AVG_WEIGHT(==64)
samples or so (most ewma implementations suffer from this bug).
Naturally, it doesn't matter much if you just keep it running forever.
However, if you will want to restart the learning process more often, which might make
sense upon changes, then the auto-tuning will be very sub-optimal.

Ronen.
