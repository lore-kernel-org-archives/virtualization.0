Hi Michael,

        Sorry for the delay, I took last week off.

Thanks: this looks really nice now.  Comments are about the text, not
the ideas.

Hmm, controlq after xmit queues... a nice improvement.

I think readers would prefer numerical order to historical order here,
so perhaps move this up in the list.

two to four?  I only see three?  And you didn't update the structure to
match...

"Following this" is vague.  After the buffer is consumed by the device.

Should not is kind of meaningless.  Let's make it clear: the device will
not steer new packets to RxqN, nor read from TxqN.

You should probably put in a note about the RFS control in the Device
Initialization section, too, ie. if you have negotiated and want to use
more queues, you must initialize them then wait for the ack of the
CTRL_RFS cmd.

Note: the following hunks didn't apply, but I'm not sure why they're in
this anyway...
