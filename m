No, we're not getting anywhere.  This is an outright broken idea.  The 
space is too small to be able to chop up in this way, and the number of 
vendors too large to be able to do it without having a central oversight.

The only way this can work is by having explicit positive identification 
of each group of leaves with a signature.  If there's a recognizable 
signature, then you can inspect the rest of the group; if not, then you 
can't.  That way, you can avoid any leaf usage which doesn't conform to 
this model, and you can also simultaneously support multiple hypervisor 
ABIs.  It also accommodates existing hypervisor use of this leaf space, 
even if they currently use a fixed location within it.

A concrete counter-proposal:

The space 0x40000000-0x400000ff is reserved for hypervisor usage.

This region is divided into 16 16-leaf blocks.  Each block has the 
structure:

0x400000x0:
    eax: max used leaf within the leaf block (max 0x400000xf)
    e[bcd]x: leaf block signature.  This may be a hypervisor-specific 
signature, or a generic signature, depending on the contents of the block

A guest may search for any supported Hypervisor ABIs by inspecting each 
leaf at 0x400000x0 for a known signature, and then may choose its mode 
of operation accordingly.  It must ignore any unknown signatures, and 
not touch any of the leaves within an unknown leaf block.

Hypervisor vendors who want to add a hypervisor-specific leaf block must 
choose a signature which is recognizably related to their or their 
hypervisor's name.

Signatures starting with "Generic" are reserved for generic leaf blocks.

A guest may scan leaf blocks to enumerate what hypervisor ABIs/hypercall 
interfaces are available to it.  It may mix and match any information 
from leaves it understands.  However, once it starts using a specific 
hypervisor ABI by making hypercalls or doing other operations with 
side-effects, it must commit to using that ABI exclusively (a specific 
hypervisor ABI may include the generic ABI by reference, however).

Correspondingly, a hypervisor must treat any cpuid accesses as 
side-effect free.

Definition of specific blocks:

Generic hypervisor leaf block:
  0x400000x0 signature is "GenericVMMIF" (or something)
  0x400000x1 tsc leaf as you've described
