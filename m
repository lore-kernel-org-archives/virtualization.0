I do like your explanation. I hope that Peter will put it in the
description as it explains the change quite well.

Uh, did I say that? Oh I said why don't make it right the first time!

I meant in terms of seperating the slowpath (aka the bytelock on the pending
bit) from the queue (MCS code). Or renaming the function to be called
'complex' instead of 'slowpath' as it is getting quite hairy.

The #1 patch is nice by itself - as it lays out the foundation of the
MCS-similar code - and if Ingo decides he does not want this pending
byte-lock bit business - it can be easily reverted or dropped.

In terms of squashing this in #1 - I would advocate against that.

Thanks!
