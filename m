It is the case with equal weights, but it is really a common one.

Yes, it could be converted, and it would do in the time domain the
same differentiation it does now in the service domain.  What we would
lose in the process is the fairness in the service domain.  The service
properties/guarantees of the resulting scheduler would _not_ be the same
as the BFQ ones.  Both long term and short term guarantees would be
affected by the unfairness given by the different service rate
experienced by the scheduled entities.
