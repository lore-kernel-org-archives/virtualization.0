That's true. It would be easy to make descriptors e.g. 32 bytes each, so
you can add extra data in there. Or if we can live with wasting some
bytes per descriptor, we could add a descriptor flag that marks the
address field as meta-data. You could then chain it with a regular
descriptor for data. However all in all the simplest option is probably
in the virtio header which can be linear with the packet.

Yes - that's because the claim was that if using descriptors in-order,
device is doing many unnecessary writes.

It seems to outperform other options on a micro-benchmark but sure,
what do you propose?

I suspect a good way to do this would be to just pass offsets within the
buffer back and forth. I agree sticking such small messages in a
separate buffer is not ideal. How about an option of replacing PA
with this data?

What good is it though? It seems to perform worse than combining
producer and consumer in my testing.

This means that device needs to do two reads just to decode the
descriptor fully. This conflicts with feedback Intel has been giving on
list which is to try and reduce number of reads. With header linear with
the packet, you need two reads to start transmitting the packet.

Seems to look like the avail bit in the kvm forum presentation.

I assume when you say completion you mean used entries, if I'm wrong
please correct me.  In fact with the proposal in the kvm forum
presentation it is possible to write used entries in a separate address
as opposed to overlapping the available entries.  If you are going to
support skipping writing back some used descriptors then accounting
would have to change slightly since driver won't be able to reset used
flags then.  But in the past in all tests I've written this separate
ring underperforms a shared ring.
