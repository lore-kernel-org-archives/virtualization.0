If the IDE drivers were real IDE ones you'd also have one Scsi_Host for
each of the as that's how libata handles in.  In a way you're much
closer to real ATA than with the previous block driver.  If your host
side support the ATA passthrough SCSI cdbs you'll even be able to
pass taskfiles to them and use tools like hdparm in the guest.
