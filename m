I did an early prototype with mprotect(), But then mprotect() didn't do exactly
what I wanted, The goal here is to prevent the guest from writing to protected
page but allow the host to do if it ever needs to at the same time.
mprotect() will
either allow both host and guest, or prevent both host and guest. Even though I
can not come up with a use case where one might need to allow host to read/write
to a page but prevent guest from writing to that page, I think that it
is a limitation
that will cost complete redesign if it proves that this kind of
behavior is undesired.
Also mprotect is kind of inflexible. Writing to mprotected pages would
immediately
trigger SIGSEGV and then userspace process will have to handle that
fault in order
to control the situation. That sounded to me more like a little hack
than a solid design.

I never thought about that, but thanks for letting me know. I will keep that in
my TODO list.

I don't think that virtio would crash that way, because host should be
able write to memory
as it wants. but yet I see where there is this going, probably I can
add hooks so that virtio
can respect the read only flags.

Here my lack of full knowledge kicks in, I am not sure whether is EPT fault or
guest pf is what I want to capture validate. I think X86 can vm exit
on both. Due to
nature of ROE, guest user space code can not have ROE because it is
irreversible, so it will be safe to assume that only pages that are
not swappable
are the one's I would care about. still lots of the details are blurry for me.
But what I was trying to say is that there is always differences based
on architecture
that is why it will be better to do things in kernel module if we
decided not to use
mprotect method.

Probably yes, still I haven't fully planned that yet. But I was thinking about
if I can make use of IOMMU protection for DMA and have something
similar for emulated devices backed by virtio.
