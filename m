I started with that, but here's the problem I wanted to
address:

- we run out of descriptors and schedule refill work
- ndo_close runs
- refill work runs
- ndo_open runs


Now if we just disable refill, refill work will not add buffers and will
not reschedule.  Now we'll never get more buffers.
We can try starting refill work from ndo_open but overall
this seems to me more risky than just splitting flags.
