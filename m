I agree.  I had to implement hkml-Sashiko integration [1] to avoid the manual
works.  People could use such existign tools or develop their own.  But I can
say Sashiko's direct mailing service has improved my dasy much more than the
hkml feature.

I agree here, too.  Apparently [2] my tooling-motivated Sashiko reply
forwarding didn't convince all.  My honest feeling was that it is not only
unconvincing but might making someone slightly annoyed.

I personally feel no problem at Sashiko review is publicly replied to my
patches, but I understand my personality is not necessarily same to others.  If
some change can make someone happy while also making someone sad, I'm up to
reducing sadness.
