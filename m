Yes, that's what I was thinking about. I have been building something
like this before, and would like to get back after merging with your
patch.

Indeed. But your 3rd patch will collapse this merit of the 3-netdev
into the former 2-netdev model - I hope it's just for demostrating the
possibility of dynamically switching ndo_ops and ethtool_ops but not
actually making it complicated in implementing this further.
