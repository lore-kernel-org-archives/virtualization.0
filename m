I don't know that you need an xchg there. If you're still on the same
CPU, it should all be nice and causal even across an interrupt handler.
So it could be:

   pda.intr_mask =3D 0; /* intr_pending can't get set after this */
   if (unlikely(pda.intr_pending)) {
      pda.intr_pending =3D 0;
      asm("sti");
   }

(This would actually need a C barrier, but I'll ignore that as this'd
end up being asm...)

But other interesting things could happen. If we never did a real CLI
and we get preempted and switched to another CPU between clearing
intr_mask and checking intr_pending, we get a little confused. =


But perhaps that doesn't matter because we'd by definition have no
pending interrupts on either processor?

Is it expensive to do an STI if interrupts are already enabled?
