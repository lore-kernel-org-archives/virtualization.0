As of today yes. Right now the yielding (call to hypervisor) in 
cpu_relax is only done for s390. Some time ago Heiko did remove 
that also from s390 with commit 57f2ffe14fd125c2 ("s390: remove 
diag 44 calls from cpu_relax()")

As it turns out this make stop_machine run really slow on virtualized
systems. For example the kprobes test during bootup took several seconds 
instead of just running unnoticed with large guests. Therefore, we 
reintroduced that with commit 4d92f50249eb ("s390: reintroduce diag 44
calls for cpu_relax()"), but the only place where we noticed the missing
yield was in the stop_machine code.

I would assume that we might find some other places where this makes
sense in the future, but I expect that we have much less places for 
yield than we need for lowlatency.

PS: We do something similar for our arch implementation for spinlocks,
but there  we use the directed yield as we know which CPU holds the lock.

I think what makes this unique is that ALL cpus spin and wait for one.
It was really the only place that I noticed a regression with Heikos
first patch.

Peter, I will fixup the patch set (I forgot to remove the lowlatency
in 2 places) and push it on my tree for linux-next. Lets see what happens.
Would the tip tree be the right place if things work out ok?
