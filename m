Agreed.  It should just be the bare minimum to make stable /dev/disk
paths, well, stable between the two backends.

vhost-scsi live migration should be easy to fix.  You need some ioctl or
eventfd mechanism to communicate to userspace that there is no pending
I/O, but you need that anyway also for other operations (as simple as
stopping the VM: QEMU guarantees that the "stop" monitor command returns
only when there is no outstanding I/O).

What worries me most is: 1) the amount of functionality that is lost
with vhost-scsi, especially the new live operations that we're adding to
QEMU; 2) whether any hook we introduce in the QEMU block layer will
cause problems down the road when we set to fix the existing
virtio-blk/virtio-scsi-qemu performance problems.  This is the reason
why I'm reluctant to merge the QEMU bits.  The kernel bits are
self-contained and are much less problematic.

It may well be that _the same_ (or very similar) hooks will be needed by
both tcm_vhost and high-performance userspace virtio backends.  This
would of course remove the objection.
