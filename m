I'm just pointing out that it's better to not have to do this.

Since TX_BUSY and requeueing the packet is unnecessary in the
first place because we can avoid it by managing the stop-queue
action properly, there is no reason to do this because of its
downsides.

Here's why I think this is not an issue.  If your NIC is high
bandwidth then your ring is going to have to be huge so the
amount that is underutilised (a 64K packet) is tiny.  If your
NIC is low bandwidth then this is where you often need QoS and
in that case you do *NOT* want to fully utilise the HW queue.

If you look at our API documentation it actually says:

        Return codes:
        o NETDEV_TX_OK everything ok.
        o NETDEV_TX_BUSY Cannot transmit packet, try later
          Usually a bug, means queue start/stop flow control is broken in
          the driver. Note: the driver must NOT put the skb in its DMA ring.
        o NETDEV_TX_LOCKED Locking failed, please retry quickly.
          Only valid when NETIF_F_LLTX is set.

So I don't feel too bad :)

The right solution is to stop the queue properly.
