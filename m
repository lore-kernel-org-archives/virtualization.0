I still think it is a hack to avoid actually fixing a driver.

I think the hack is better as a quirk.  I think the quirk would tend to
be better if it was limited to whatever set of hypervisors where this is
actually a problem.

And of course given that on any sane configuration we have the irq
watchdog I don't see what this is fixing in practice.

Other than suggesting this hack become find a way to limit itself to the
driver that is actually having problems I don't see a way to improve it.
