This is actually a bug. This means that one slow connection will
affect fast ones. I intend to change the default for qemu to sndbuf=3D0=
 :
this will fix it but break your "pacing". So pls do not count on this b=

The fix is at the application level. Run netperf with -b and -w flags t=
o
limit the speed to a sensible value.
