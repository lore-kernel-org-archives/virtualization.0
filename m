Can you outline how this can be done?  From a quick look over the code
it seems like vsock has a hard dependency on vmci, is that correct?

When making vsock a generic, reusable kernel service it should be the
other way around:  vsock should provide the core implementation and an
interface where hypervisor-specific transports (vmci, virtio, xenbus,
...) can register themself.

cheers,
