To reduce the possibility of dropping or losing of gratuitous packet by 
the network, qemu usually send the gratuitous packets for many times ( 
currently 5 time with a increment gap between them such as 50ms, 150ms, 
250ms ...). As there's no method can guarantee the gratuitous packet 
were received by switch in guest, no need to care about the coalesced 
notifications in guest. And we may leave the work to qemu or just don't 
care about this.
