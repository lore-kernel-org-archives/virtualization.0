What?  That changelog comment makes no sense at all, as you are patching
the staging version of the driver.  This isn't an acceptable patch at
all.

Yes, I have pending patches for this driver in my "to-apply" queue, but
that is for 3.4, not now.

So, how about I just apply those patches, and then apply a patch that
moves it out of staging into drivers/scsi/, and queue all of those up
for 3.4.

James, any objection to that?

thanks,
