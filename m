Well, it'd be easy to just add pa_high.

Well, look at my patches. See how each new feature basically adds *one*
if statement.

Yes, we could declare all existing features to be required,
this is what you are advocating. But in a couple of years
more if statements have accumulated and we still don't have
a flying car. Meanwhile the driver has a huge legacy section
which is a huge pain to maintain.

Wow. Is everyone going for the rewrite these days?
After a lot of work we will be back at the point where we left,
with a minor tweak to enable a huge number of slow devices.
Meanwhile we have no time to work on real problems,
such as ring fragmentation that Avi pointed out,
support for very large requests.


And yes it will hurt, it will hurt bisectability and testability.
What you propose is a huge patch that just changes all of it.
If there's a breakage, bisect just points at a rewrite.
What I would like to see is incremental patches. So I would like to
1. Split driver config from common config
2. Split isr/notifications out too
3. Copy config in MMIO
4. Add a new config
5. Add length checks
6. Add 64 bit features
7. Add alignment programming

At each point we can bisect.  It worked well for event index, qemu had a
flag to turn it off, each time someone came in and went 'maybe it's
event index' we just tested without.

Maybe. What about windows drivers?

All you do is move stuff around. Why do you think it simplifies the spec
so much?

Just to clarify: you assume that if virtio pci spec is changed, then
there will be many more new implementations than existing ones, so it is
worth it to make life (temporarily, for several short years) harder for
all the existing ones?

Look at the qemu side for example. The way I proposed - with optional
capabilities, each one with a separate fallback - the change can be
implemented very gradually.  Each step will be bisectable, and testable.

This does not make life easy for implementations as they
need to implement it anyway. What makes life easy is
making new features optional, so you pick just what you like.

For example, we might want to backport some new feature into
rhel6.X at some point. I would like the diff to be small,
and easily understandable in its impact.
