Ok.

Yea, with that background it makes more sense.  I think we can reduce
number of hooks though.

Looking at vsock_stream_sendmsg:
  * notify_send_init -- needed I guess.
  * notify_send_pre_block -- needed too, I guess you'll force signaling
    the peer here (buffers full and there is more data).
  * notify_send_pre_enqueue + notify_send_post_enqueue look like they
    could easily be folded into stream_enqueue.

Sure virtio signals, we have to if we don't want poll ;)

Usually virtio only signals in case it finds the ring empty, if there
are requests not yet processed by the peer there is no need to signal.
The ring lives in guest memory and to figure whenever the peer has seen
the requests in there we only need a memory barrier, not a vmexit.

In the end it is up to the driver when he signals the peer.  The virtio
net driver goes beyond the simple "signal-when-the-ring-is-empty" and
has some logic for coalescing things when there is a high network load,
while trying to not trade that for high latencies when the virtual nic
is almost idle.

I guess you try archiving something simliar with vsock/vmci using the
notifications, and yes, we might want use them with virtio too some day.
 Most likely not for the first revision though, there are more important
issues to tackle first.

Yea, it's probably better to discuss+collect the refinements and send
them batched.

But makes sense even if it isn't that pretty.

But /me wonders why you maintain the notify state per-call and not
per-socket/queuepair.  For the data flow it shouldn't make a difference
whenever the application does a few send(big-buffer) or many
send(small-buffer) calls.

There is already vsock->sk.sk_state ...

cheers,
