WHAT?  I can't figure out what an arch needs to do to support this?  Why
is it an option for archs?  Why is sg_chain() even defined for
non-ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN?

Jens, help!!

All archs we care about support them, though, so I think we can ignore
this issue for now.

We lost that debate 5 years ago, so we hack around it as needed.  We can
add helpers to append if we need.

Thanks,
Rusty.
