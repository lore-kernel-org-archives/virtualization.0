That's a pure academic exercise. When we are at the point where
nanoseconds are to coarse - sometimes after we both retired - the
internal resolution will be femtoseconds or whatever fits.

Again: paravirt should use a common infrastructure for this. Virtual
clocksource and virtual clockevent devices, which operate on ktime_t and
not on some artificial clock chip emulation frequency. The backend
implementation will be still per hypervisor, but we have _ONE_ device
emulation model, which is exposed to the kernel instead of five.

On a Linux based host, you probably end up with a hrtimer on the host
side to schedule the next event on the guest. So why do we need to
convert ktime_t to some virtual frequency in the guest so we can convert
it back into ktime_t on the host ?

Abstractions for the abstractions sake are braindead. There is no real
reason to implement 128 bit math into that path just to make the virtual
clockevent device look like real hardware.

The abstraction of clockevents helps you to get rid of hardwired
hardware assumptions, but you insist on creating them artificially for
reasons which are beyond my grasp.

Sigh. The gain is, that you still have a good reason, why you can't move
to the clockevents interface.

Jeremy spent a couple of hours to get NO_HZ running for Xen yesterday
instead of writing up lengthy excuses, why it is soooo hard and takes
sooo much time and the current interface is sooo insufficient.
