0day had one crash on the last round, I think Steve send a fix for that
last night and I'll go look at it.

That said, the last posting got 0 feedback, so either everybody is
really happy with it, or not interested. So let us know in the thread,
with some review feedback.

Once I get through enough of the inbox to actually find the fix and test
it, I'll also update the thread, and maybe threaten to merge it if
everybody stays silent :-)
