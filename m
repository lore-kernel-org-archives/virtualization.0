Perhaps this would make a good topic for a BoF session at the upcoming
netdev. A new ring structure can be useful elsewhere, too, such as for
af_packet v4.

The ring is always read-write, as the consumer has to toggle the
DESC_DRIVER flag, right? Which mode are you referring to?

Virtio rings are used in both directions between guest device driver and
host device, as well as in increasingly many situations outside vm i/o.

I suggest using producer and consumer instead of driver and device
when describing ring operations.

When working on the virtio-net tx path, having to invert all the documentation
in my head, because it is written from an rx point of view was a bit tricky ;-)

I would then also convert DESC_DRIVER to DESC_VALID or so.

So, the flag effectively doubles the namespace of the id from 16 bit to
17 bit? Instead, how about using a larger identifier. Such as 32 bit.

This also future proofs the design for cases where the ring may grow
to exceed 65536 entries. Doing so is not a short term change, but it
ould avoid the need for indirect descriptors and give greated room
for out of order acknowledgement.

Why this constraint on the ring?

Does this mean that completing a descriptor by the consumer implicitly
completes all descriptors that precede it in the ring?

I don't quite follow this.

Is this ever larger than 16-bit? If not, then reducing to 16-bit allows
growing index to 32-bit.

This is a per-ring flag, as opposed to the per-descriptor flags DESC_*.
Please make that explicit and state in which structure it is set.

Why? This is the same question as above, really. This seems like a
device constraint, not necessarily a constraint to impose on the ring
format.

This does explain the above constraint. I guess that I just do not
understand the reason for this behavior.

Isn't this a descriptor flag, so DESC_NEXT?

Can you elaborate on the last part about optional write and read buffer?

If so, then the explicit flag is not needed?

This can be forbidden, by requiring the producer to set the
DESC_DRIVER bit on the first descriptor only after the entire
chain has been written.

Do chains have to consist of consecutive descriptors?

Multiple of sizeof(struct indirect_desc).

Also, struct indirect_desc is identical to struct desc. No need for a
separate struct definition?

This is just a linear array, right?

Sounds like unnecessary complexity.

Agreed. This also resembles physical devices more closely.
