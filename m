Thanks!

Yes, the console stuff works nicely for me, and the installer is
happy.

Note that I went with the stupidest solution that could possibly work
there: have a global flag that gets set when the command line sets
consoles, and don't mess with the console then.  Mark McLoughlin
suggested a somewhat less stupid way, namely to mark consoles selected
on the command line with a flag.  Critical review invited!
