Pity - seems to work back on 2.6.26:

Still, even with that (or SIGSTOP) we don't really know where the packets were 
dropped right?  There is no guarantee they weren't dropped before they got to 
the socket buffer

happy benchmarking,

PS - here is with a -S 1024 option:

raj@tardy:~/netperf2_trunk$ src/netperf -t UDP_STREAM -- -S 1024 -m 1024

   2048           10.00     1490662           1221.13

showing that there is a decent chance that many of the frames were dropped at 
the socket buffer, but not all - I suppose I could/should be checking netstat 
stats... :)

And just a little more, only because I was curious :)
