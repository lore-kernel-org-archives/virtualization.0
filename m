But if you separate out the ring logic, it allows the scsi logic to be 
shared by other paravirtual device drivers.  This is significant and 
important from a Linux point of view.

There is almost nothing vmware specific about the vast majority of your 
code.  If you split out the scsi logic, then you will receive help 
debugging, adding future features, and improving performance from other 
folks interested in this.  In the long term, it will make your life 
much, much easier by making the driver relevant to a wider audience :-)

I am certainly not the block subsystem maintainer, but I'd hate to see 
this merged without any attempt at making the code more reusable.  If 
adding the virtio layering is going to somehow hurt performance, break 
your ABI, or in some way limit you, then that's something to certainly 
discuss and would be valid concerns.  That said, I don't think it's a 
huge change to your current patch and I don't see any obvious problems 
it would cause.
