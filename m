No, I don't think it is always possible. The issuers may not exist when
an io-scheduler or other modules start to handle the I/O requests.
I know you can make linux kernel preserve all the context of the issuers
until all the I/O requests belonging to them have finished, but it may
lead waste of resources.

I think this is the reason why io_context was introduced.
