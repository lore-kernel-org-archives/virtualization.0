Hi Chris,

Thanks a bunch for your really thorough review! I'll answer some of your questions here. Shreyas can respond to your comments about some of the coding style/comments/etc. in a separate mail.

When we first wrote the driver a couple of years ago, Linux lacked proper multiqueue support, hence we chose to use only a single queue though the emulated device does support 16 Rx and 8 Tx queues, and 25 MSI-X vectors: 16 for Rx, 8 for Tx and 1 for other asynchronous event notifications, by design. Actually a driver can repurpose any of the 25 vectors for any notifications; just explaining the rationale for desiging the device with 25 MSI-X vectors.

We do have an internal prototype of a Linux vmxnet3 driver with 4 Tx queues and 4 Rx queues, using 9 MSI-X vectors, but it needs some work before calling it production ready.

> How about GRO conversion?

Looks attractive, and we'll work on that in a subsequent patch. Again, when we first wrote the driver, the NETIF_F_GRO stuff didn't exist in Linux.

We'll definitely audit all the BUG_ONs again to make sure they can't be exploited.

Nice catch! Those are not even used and are from the earliest days of our driver development. We'll nuke those.

Yes, the Linux driver currently only asks for adaptive mode, but the device supports 8 interrupt moderation levels.

No need for packing since the fields are naturally 64-bit aligned. True for all structures shared between the driver and device.

These are the authoritiative #defines. Ignore the UPT ones.

Fair enough. We were just trying to clearly show which register accesses go to BAR 0 versus BAR 1.

Yes.

Yes, and the device is configurable to use any vector for any "events", but didn't see any compelling reason to do so. "ECR" events are extremely rare and we've got a shadow copy of the ECR register that avoids an expensive round trip to the device, stored in adapter->shared->ecr. So we can cheaply handle events on the hot Tx/Rx path with minimal overhead. But if you really see a compelling reason to allocate a separate MSI-X vector for events, we can certainly do that.

Already answered.
