Would it be ok if I were to make this change after Jiri accepts the driver out of staging?

I look forward to Jiri's ruling here. On a different note, you had asked me to
make a couple of structures const structures that were statically initialized - the 
ack structure and the request structure. I am running into some issues doing that.
The low level ring buffer code uses  struct scatterlists and  for some reason the behavior 
of dynamically allocated structures (as well as stack variables) is different when it comes to
the following transformation: VA ->Page->VA. For dynamically allocated data this transformation
gives us the original VA; while for module global data, this transformation gives me a different VA.
And so, after I made the change you had recommended (making the two variables static variables),
the driver does not work and I have tracked this problem to the transformation noted earlier. Is this 
transformation not valid for static data? 

If it is ok with you, I will send the patch out with all the other cleanup that you had suggested.
