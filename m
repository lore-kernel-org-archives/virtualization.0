OK :)  I think we'll only ever want to bind to a hypervisor once, since
the underlying hypervisor can't change on the fly (well, in principle it
might if you migrate, but you'll have more problems than just dealing
with the hook points).  And lazy binding doesn't buy much; I think its
much better to get it all out of the way at once, and then throw the
reloc info away.

Right, that's pretty much what we do now.

I see.  We want to do something conceptually like this, but we need to
handle more than just adjusting which of two constants to use as a
mask.  For example, Xen needs to run pfns through a pfn->mfn (machine
frame number) conversion and back when making/unpacking pagetable entries.
