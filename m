Yes, SWIOTLB sizing is hard. It really depends on the workload and the
associated I/O load that the guest will be performing. We've been looking
at a simple patch to increase the default SWIOTLB size if SEV is active.
But what size do you choose? Do you base it on the overall guest size? And
you're limited because it must reside low in memory.

Ideally, having a pool of shared pages for DMA, outside of standard
SWIOTLB, might be a good thing.  On x86, SWIOTLB really seems geared
towards devices that don't support 64-bit DMA. If a device supports 64-bit
DMA then it can use shared pages that reside anywhere to perform the DMA
and bounce buffering. I wonder if the SWIOTLB support can be enhanced to
support something like this, using today's low SWIOTLB buffers if the DMA
mask necessitates it, otherwise using a dynamically sized pool of shared
pages that can live anywhere.

Thanks,
Tom
