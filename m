I use a heart-beat counter to see if the other side responses within a 
certain time limit. If not, I assume it has been scheduled out probably 
due to PLE.

Yes, unfair lock should only be enabled if it is running under a 
para-virtualized guest. A jump label (static key) is used for this 
purpose and will be enabled by the appropriate KVM or Xen code.

Yes, you are right. I will remove that in the next series.

Enabling unfair lock will add additional code which has a slight 
performance penalty of 1-2% on both bare-metal and virtualized.

The static key will only be changed only in the early boot period which 
I presumably doesn't need to use spinlock. This static key is 
initialized in the same way as the PV ticketlock's static key which has 
the same problem that you mentioned.
