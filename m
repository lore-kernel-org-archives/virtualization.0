Christoph,

Let me begin by first thanking you for your detailed review. I have addressed all the issues you have
identified - the code looks much better now; thank you! I am currently testing this code and I will post
the patches soon - individual patches against the current code in the staging tree as well as a patch to
move the driver out of staging (as I have done in the past). Please find my responses to your comments
in-line.

Regards,

K. Y

I have consolidated all of the protocol defines at the start of the file and
these are properly commented. The decision to not have a separate header file
was based on the comments I got from the community a while ago. Hopefully,
this consolidation will address all the concerns.

I don't have any reference counting anymore. I have added a comment
explaining the protocol for managing the life-cycle.

With GFP_ATOMIC flag, the allocation I think can fail. At least that is what
mempool_alloc() comment says.

This state is not in the scsi_host_template. What am I missing here.
