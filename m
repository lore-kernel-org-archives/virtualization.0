No, logical block devices doesn't have any request queues and
they essentially won't block any bios unless it is impossible to
handle them at the moment. Device-mappers never touch any request queues.

I think it's easy to just make all logical device --- device mapper
device  --- and all physical device have their own bandwidth control
mechanism.
But I'm not clear how your algorithm works to control the bandwidth.
At which level are you going to guarantee the bandwidth, at the logical
volumes layer such as lvm or at the physical device layer?

Thanks,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
