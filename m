/dev/random can return after at least 64 bits received in the input_pool 
whereas getrandom waits for 128 bits.

Sure, because there is one byte in the input_pool at the time user space 
boots. Note again, /dev/random waits until having 64 bits.

I would say that this is expected.

Sure, it does not update the input_pool. Only the IOCTL can update the 
input_pool from user space.

Nope, I do not think that this is true:

- /dev/random returns one byte for one byte of entropy received, but it has a 
lower limit of 64 bits

- getrandom behaves like /dev/urandom (i.e. nonblocking) except during boot 
where it waits until the RNG has collected 128 bits before operating like a 
DRNG that is seeded once in a while when entropy comes in.
