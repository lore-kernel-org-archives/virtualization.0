Oh, here I catch up. I was wondering why there're ordering issues when 
talking
about virtio-scsi, since in SAM3, the third and the last paragraph of 
section
4.6.3 Request/Response ordering clearly describe it:

The manner in which ordering constraints are established is vendor 
specific. An
implementation may delegate this responsibility to the application client
(e.g., the device driver). In-order delivery may be an intrinsic property of
the service delivery subsystem or a requirement established by the SCSI
transport protocol standard.

To simplify the description of behavior, the SCSI architecture model assumes
in-order delivery of requests or responses to be a property of the service
delivery subsystem. This assumption does not constitute a requirement.  The
SCSI architecture model makes no assumption about and places no 
requirement on
the ordering of requests or responses for different I_T nexuses.

So if I understand correctly, virtio-scsi looks like an SCSI tranport 
protocol,
such as iSCSI, FCP and SRP which use tcp/ip, FC and Infiniband RDMA
respectively as the transfer media while virtio-scsi uses virtio, an 
virtual IO
channel, as the transfer media?
