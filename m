NetQueue is really for scaling across multiple VMs. NPA allows similar scaling
and also helps in improving the CPU efficiency for a single VM since the
hypervisor is bypassed. Througput wise both emulation and passthrough (NPA) can
obtain line rates on 10gig but passthrough saves upto 40% cpu based on the
workload. We did a demo at IDF 2009 where we compared 8 VMs running on NetQueue
v/s 8 VMs running on NPA (using Niantic) and we obtained similar CPU efficiency
gains.

NPA and UPT share a lot of code in the hypervisor. UPT was adopted only by very
limited IHVs and hence NPA is our way forward to have all IHVs onboard.

We have it working internally with Intel Niantic (10G) and Kawela (1G) SR-IOV
NIC. We are also working with upcoming Broadcom 10G card and plan to support
other IHVs. This is unlike UPT so we don't dictate the register sets or rings
like we did in UPT. Rather we have guidelines like that the card should have an
embedded switch for inter VF switching or should support programming (rx
filters, VLAN, etc) though the PF driver rather than the VF driver.

I am not sure what do you mean by symmetric view of SR-IOV world?

NPA allows multi-queue VFs and requires an embedded switch currently. As far as
the PF driver is concerned we require IHVs to support all existing and upcoming
features like NetQueue, FCoE, etc. The PF driver is considered special and is
used to drive the traffic for the emulated/paravirtualized VMs and is also used
to program things on behalf of the VFs through the hypervisor. If the hardware
has multiple physical functions they are treated as separate adapters (with
their own set of VFs) and we require the embedded switch to maintain that
distinction as well.

The setup is 2.667Ghz Nehalem server running SLES11 VM talking to a 2.33Ghz
Barcelona client box running RHEL 5.1. We had netperf streams with 16k msg size
over 64k socket size running between server VM and client and they are using
Intel Niantic 10G cards. In both cases (NPA and regular) the VM was CPU
saturated (used one full core).

TX: regular vmxnet3 = 3085.5 Mbps/GHz; NPA vmxnet3 = 4397.2 Mbps/GHz
RX: regular vmxnet3 = 1379.6 Mbps/GHz; NPA vmxnet3 = 2349.7 Mbps/GHz

We have similar results for other configuration and in general we have seen NPA
is better in terms of CPU cost and can save upto 40% of CPU cost.

All operations other than TX/RX go through the vmxnet3 shell to the vmxnet3
device emulation. So the control plane is really the vmxnet3 device emulation
as far as the guest is concerned.

One guest-agnostic plugin per VF implementation. Yes, the plugin is injected
into the guest by the hypervisor.

Yes it would be GPL and we are thinking of enforcing the license in the
hypervisor as well as in the shell.

> How does the shell switch back to emulated mode for live migration?

The hypervisor sends a notification to the shell to switch out of passthrough
and it quiesces the VF and tears down the mapping between VF and the guest. The
shell free's up the buffers and other resources on behalf of the plugin and
reinitializes the s/w vmxnet3 emulation plugin.

We have an internal prototype working but we are not yet ready to post the
patch to LKML. We are still in the process of making changes to our windows
driver and want to ensure that we take into account all changes that could
happen.
