Kamezawa-San, I am not dead against it, but I would provide a knob/control point
for system administrator to decide if movement is important for applications,
then let them do so (like force_empty).

Are you planning on reposting these. I've been trying other approaches at my end

1. Use radix tree per-node per-zone
2. Use radix trees only for 32 bit systems
3. Depend on CONFIG_HAVE_MEMORY_PRESENT and build a sparse data structure and
use pre-allocation

I've posted (1) and I'll take a look at your patches as well

Yes, it is getting better
