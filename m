Hmm so that one looks like a QEMU bug (does not expose poison flag).  In
the past we just said need to fix the bug where it's found unless the
issue is very widespread and major.  Let's assume QEMU learns to always
expose POISON with HINT.  Then this configuration (HINT && !POISON)
allows us to detect old QEMU (pre your changes).

I am also interested in the following question:
Is this good for anything? In particular are there any bugs in HINT
we can fix using this hack?

E.g. I know HINT does not obey MUST_TELL_HOST under OOM.  But that
unfortunately is a guest not a host bug, so this hack does not seem
useful.

I'll try to think about VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_FREE_PAGE_HINT situation
over the weekend. But for the new page reporting, why not
assume host implementation will be sane?
