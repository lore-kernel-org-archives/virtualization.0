If you could set, it, yes. But at least linux ignores
any value substantially smaller than 1K, and then
multiplies that by 2:

        case SO_RCVBUF:
                /* Don't error on this BSD doesn't and if you think
                   about it this is right. Otherwise apps have to
                   play 'guess the biggest size' games. RCVBUF/SNDBUF
                   are treated in BSD as hints */

                if (val > sysctl_rmem_max)
                        val = sysctl_rmem_max;
set_rcvbuf:     
                sk->sk_userlocks |= SOCK_RCVBUF_LOCK;

                /*
                 * We double it on the way in to account for
                 * "struct sk_buff" etc. overhead.   Applications
                 * assume that the SO_RCVBUF setting they make will
                 * allow that much actual data to be received on that
                 * socket.
                 *
                 * Applications are unaware that "struct sk_buff" and
                 * other overheads allocate from the receive buffer
                 * during socket buffer allocation. 
                 *
                 * And after considering the possible alternatives,
                 * returning the value we actually used in getsockopt
                 * is the most desirable behavior.
                 */ 
                if ((val * 2) < SOCK_MIN_RCVBUF)
                        sk->sk_rcvbuf = SOCK_MIN_RCVBUF;
                else
                        sk->sk_rcvbuf = val * 2;

and

/*

 */             
#define SOCK_MIN_RCVBUF (2048 + sizeof(struct sk_buff))

Ah, sounds perfect.
