Hi,
Here is the version 3 of NOKPORBE_SYMBOL series.

Currently the blacklist is maintained by hand in kprobes.c 
which is separated from the function definition and is hard
to catch up the kernel update.

To solve this issue, I've introduced NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() macro
for making kprobe blacklist at build time. Since the
NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() macros can be placed right after the
function is defined (as like as EXPORT_SYMBOL), it is
easy to maintain.

This series replaces __kprobes with NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() macro
or apply __always_inline annotation for some cases, because
NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() will inhibit inlining by referring the
symbol address. :(

At this point, I replaced all __kprobes under kernel/ and
arch/x86. For future work, I'd like to replace all the
__kprobes annotation for all archs too.

Also, I decided to classify current __kprobes annotation
users who misuse it. Most of the preparation, registration,
optimization functions related to kprobes are not involved
in the breakpoint or other exception handling.
This means that those never cause problems such as infinite
recursion if we put kprobes on it.
This also reduces blacklist a lot.

For easy to check the blacklist, you can see what address
region/symbols are not allowed to probe via
/sys/kernel/debug/kprobes/blacklist.

Since the new blacklist can be populated/shrinked dynamically,
the blacklist now also support modules. :)
kprobes users can make a custom blacklisted functions which
will be called from kprobes handlers. Example codes are also
updated, so you can see how it works.

This series also includes a change which prohibits probing
on the address in .entry.text because the code is used for
very low-level sensitive interrupt/syscall entries. Probing
such code may cause unexpected result (actually most of
that area is already in the kprobe blacklist).
So I've decide to prohibit probing all of them.

Finally, I got an empty .kprobes.text on x86 :)

$ grep kprobes_text System.map
ffffffff81604980 T __kprobes_text_end
ffffffff81604980 T __kprobes_text_start

Thank you,

Changes from v2 to v3:
 - Introduce arch_within_kprobe_blacklist() which checks
   the address is within the .kprobes.text (generic,x86) or
   .entry.text (x86), for fixing build issue on !x86.
 - Rename in_nokprobes_functions to within_kprobe_blacklist
   and it returns a bool value istead of an error.
 - Fix the type of kprobe_blacklist_seq_stop().
 - Use blacklist entry to check the blacklisted address
   ranges (.entry.text/.kprobes.text). This also eliminates
   arch_within_kprobe_blacklist(). :)

Changes from v1 to v2:
 - Replace __kprobes with NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() and remove
   unneeded __kprobes on the files compiled on x86.
 - Add blacklist on modules support.
 - Add debugfs interface for blacklist.
 - Fix indent of the NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() by using tabs.
 - Fix NOKPROBE_SYMBOL() for expanding nested macro.
 - Update Documentations/kprobes.txt about blacklist.
