My mistake; I will have a more descriptive comment.

Greg; this is the patch that consolidates the state in  struct hv_driver into 
struct driver_context. In the spirit of doing one thing in a patch;
other relevant changes are made in:
Patch[5/6]: Changes the name driver_context to hyperv_driver
Patch[6/6]: Cleanup all variable names that refer to struct hyperv_driver.

As I noted in a different email, may be the granularity I chose in breaking up
these patches is causing all this confusion.

Greg, would it be better if I just had one patch for dealing with all device related issues and a
Separate patch for dealing all driver related issues?
