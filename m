He's welcome to pick up the necessary code from qemu.

You instantiate multiple vhost-nets.  Multiple ethernet NICs is a 
supported configuration for kvm.

I don't really see the difference between 1 and N here.

I'm not sure if you're talking about the configuration interface or data 
path here.

They aren't in the "guest".  The best way to look at it is

- a device side, with a dma engine: vhost-net
- a driver side, only accessing its own memory: virtio-net

Given that Ira's config has the dma engine in the ppc boards, that's 
where vhost-net would live (the ppc boards acting as NICs to the x86 
board, essentially).

I have no idea, that's for Ira to solve.  If he could fake the PCI 
config space as seen by the x86 board, he would just show the normal pci 
config and use virtio-pci (multiple channels would show up as a 
multifunction device).  Given he can't, he needs to tunnel the virtio 
config space some other way.

Let me rephrase.  The virtio developers are virtualization oriented.  If 
it works for non-virt applications, that's good, but not a design goal.
