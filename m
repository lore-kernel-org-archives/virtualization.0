After more careful reading, I think the assumption that the presence of 
an unused bucket means there is no match is not true. Consider the scenario:

1. cpu 0 puts lock1 into hb[0]
2. cpu 1 puts lock2 into hb[1]
3. cpu 2 clears hb[0]
4. cpu 3 looks for lock2 and doesn't find it

I was thinking about putting some USED flag in the buckets, but then we 
will eventually fill them all up as used. If we put the entries into a 
hashed linked list, we have to deal with the complicated synchronization 
issues with link list update.

At this point, I am thinking using back your previous idea of passing 
the queue head information down the queue. I am now convinced that the 
unlock call site patching should work. So I will incorporate that in my 
next update.

Please let me know if you think my reasoning is not correct.

Thanks,
Longman
