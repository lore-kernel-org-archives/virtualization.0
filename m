Yep, makes sense. In theory the old content or being filled with
poison_val should be the same thing.

I got to the root cause of the issues I was seeing. The config size
being dependent on the page poison feature was somewhat problematic as
it affects where I can place the setting of the bit since I have to
have it done before we call virtio_init. I should be submitting the
patches this afternoon. I am just going through and making sure I have
my bases covered and testing for any corner cases.
