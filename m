I've encountered that pattern so far mostly for driver-internal I/O
(setting some stuff up via channel commands etc.) Other usages (like
e.g. the dasd driver processing block layer requests) are asynchronous,
and the common I/O layer uses a full-fledged fsm. Much of the trouble
comes from implementing a synchronous interface via asynchronous
commands, and I'd really like to keep that as simple as possible
(especially as this is not the hot path).

No, that sounds good to me.

Do you spot any other places where we may need to care about concurrent
processing (like for the ->config area in the previous patch)?
