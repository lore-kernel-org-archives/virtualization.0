Well, features may be orthogonal but they are still added sequentially
to the ABI. So, you would have a kind of implicit ABI versioning, while
still allowing individual selection of features.

e.g. if NET_F_FOO adds "int foo" to the header and then NET_F_BAR adds
"int bar" to the header then if NET_F_FOO is negotiated, the guest
should only send a header with "foo" and if NET_F_FOO|NET_F_BAR or
NET_F_BAR is negotiated, then the guest sends a header with both "foo"
and "bar".

Or put it another way, a host or guest may not implement NET_F_FOO but
knowledge of the "foo" header field is part of the ABI of NET_F_BAR.
That knowledge would be as simple as knowing that the field exists and
that it should be ignored if the feature isn't used.

Cheers,
Mark.
