Why printk from a .h file?

No, please no.

Align these properly?  Why do they need to be in a .h file?

Is this needed at all anymore?

This isn't needed, use the built-in macro instead.

That's not how you do this, sorry.  Please do it like the rest of the
kernel.

With the new uapi rework, should this file still be here?  What about
the other .h files?

Ick, no typdefs please.

You return a structure on the stack that just went away?  Yeah, I know
it's an inline, but come on, that's not ok.

It's longer to write the macro out than to just do .context or
.resource, just use them instead.

Inline function instead?  How often do you really need this?

C99 initializers please.

Gotta love magic values :(

So you just created an invalid message?

Are you sure all of this stuff needs to be in a .h file that lives in
include/linux/?

I don't recall ever getting a valid answer for this (if you did, my
appologies, can you repeat it).  What in the world are you talking about
here?  Why is your driver somehow special from the thousands of other
ones that use the in-kernel IO macros properly for an ioctl?

What do you mean here?  What are you trying to work around?  And why?

Who's reserving them?  If they aren't in the driver, no need to list
them here at all, who would ever call them?  I think this is due to your
"weird" way of defining ioctls, please don't.

Same as above.

As you don't have any in-kernel code using these ioctls, why define them
yet?

And again, what's with the "reserving" ioctls?  That's not ok.

I still don't understand, sorry.

Please redo this in the "normal" Linux kernel way of defining ioctls.
No need to be "special" here.

And shouldn't something like this be in a separate .h file, that gets
included from userspace?  Not all of the stuff in this .h file should
get exported to userspace, right?

Where have I see this before... :)
