This is exactly the point. There is no benfit in reusing 3 lines of
lapic interrupt handler code and therefor reaching into it. clockevents
are not connected to lapic on SMP by any means. They are designed to be
self contained and so please use them as designed.

You managed to avoid the usage of other code (i.e. PIT / HPET) already,
so why is it sooo desireable to emulate apics instead of substituting it
by a small and sane replacement ? Just because you happen to have an
LAPIC emulator ? That's no reason to wire yourself into the kernel code
and make it harder to change and maintain.

Again: clockevents do not require APIC and do not depend on any APIC
wiring. Your hypervisor is working that way.

We have to avoid this reachout in the first place. It just adds more
hardwires into the hairball and makes it harder to distangle. 

If you want the virtualization support in the kernel, then please
understand that we hardwire now and we'll fix it up once the core kernel
developers serve us the solution on the silver tablet is not going to
work. Please work with us on a proper solution upfront instead of
throwing random hackery with the lame excuse "for a good reason" at us.

You knew exactly, that clockevents & co are on the way to mainline and
there was enough time to work with us on a proper solution. No, you
decided to ignore it, even after people pointed it out to you way before
the 2.6.21 merge window. Now we have the hardwire in place and we can
wait for you to fix it whenever it seems to fit into the vmware business
plan.

I'm not going to accept any further reachout unless there is an urgent
bugfix in the release cycle, which does not allow a proper solution. But
be sure, that the backout patch will hit -mm immidiately.
