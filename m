Some general questions/issues with the approach this patchset takes:
1. Lack of host-guest synchronization for flow hash.
   On the host side, things will scale if the same vhost thread
   handles both transmit and receive for a specific flow.
   Further, things will scale
   if packets from distinct guest queues get routed to
   distict queues on the NIC and tap devices in the host.
   It seems that to achieve both, host and guest
   need to pass  the flow hash information to each other.
   Ben Hutchings suggested effectively pushing the guest's
   RFS socket map out to the host.  Any thoughts on this?
2. Reduced batching/increased number of exits.
   It's easy to see that the amount of work per VQ
   is reduced with this patch. Thus it's easy to imagine
   that under some workloads, where we previously had
   X packets per VM exit/interrupt, we'll now have X/N with N
   the number of virtqueues. Since both a VM exit and an interrupt
   are expensive operations, one wonders whether this can
   lead to performance regressions.
   It seems that to reduce the chance of such, some adaptive
   strategy would work better. But how would we ensure
   packets aren't reordered then? Any thoughts?
3. Lack of userspace resource control.
   A vhost-net device already uses quite a lot of resources.
   This patch seems to make the problem worse. At the moment,
   management can to some level control that by using a file
   descriptor per virtio device. So using a file descriptor
   per VQ has an advantage of limiting the amount of resources
   qemu can consume.  In April, Jason posted a qemu patch that supported
   a multiqueue guest by using existing vhost interfaces, by opening
   multiple devices, one per queue.
   It seems that this can be improved upon, if we allow e.g. sharing
   of memory maps between file descriptors.
   This might also make adaptive queueing strategies possible.
   Would it be possible to do this instead?

Please do. Small message throughput would be especially interesting.
