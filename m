I have a workload where MAX_PRIO RT thread runs and never yeilds. That's what
my cpu isolation patches/tree addresses. Stopmachine is the only (that I know
of) thing that really brakes in that case. btw In case you're wondering yes
we've discussed workqueue threads starvation and stuff in the other threads.
So yet it can happen.

How about this. We'll make this a sysctl, as Rusty already did, and set the
default to 0 which means "never timeout". That way crazy people like me who
care about this scenario can enable this feature.

btw Rusty, I just had this "why didn't I think of that" moments. This is
actually another way of handling my workload. I mean it certainly does not fix
the root case of the problems and we still need other things that we talked
about (non-blocking module delete, lock-free module insertion, etc) but at
least in the mean time it avoids wedging the machines for good.
btw I'd like that timeout in milliseconds. I think 5 seconds is way tooooo
long :).
