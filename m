Right, the driver could, in theory, do:
        add_buf()
        if (!get_buf())
                notify()

But we don't allow that at the moment in our API: we insist on a notify
occasionally.  Noone does this at the moment, so a WARN_ON is correct.

If you're just add_buf() without the get_buf() then add_buf() will fail
already.

Here's my current variant:

diff --git a/drivers/virtio/virtio_ring.c b/drivers/virtio/virtio_ring.c
--- a/drivers/virtio/virtio_ring.c
+++ b/drivers/virtio/virtio_ring.c
@@ -245,9 +245,19 @@ add_head:
 
 	/* Put entry in available array (but don't update avail->idx until they
 	 * do sync). */
-	avail = ((vq->vring.avail->idx + vq->num_added++) & (vq->vring.num-1));
+	avail = (vq->vring.avail->idx & (vq->vring.num-1));
 	vq->vring.avail->ring[avail] = head;

+	WARN_ON(vq->num_added > vq->vring.num);
+
 	pr_debug("Added buffer head %i to %p\n", head, vq);
 	END_USE(vq);
 
It's hard to write a useful WARN_ON() for the "you should kick more
regularly" case (we could take timestamps if DEBUG is defined, I guess),
so let's leave this until someone actually trips it.

Thanks,
Rusty.
