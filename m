The idea is _NOT_ that you go look for references to the paravirt_ops
members structure, that would be stupid and you wouldn't be able to
use the most efficient addressing mode on a given cpu, you'd be
patching up indirect calls and crap like that.  Just say no...

Instead you get rid of paravirt ops completely, and you call functions
whose symbol name will not resolve in the initial kernel link.

You do an initial link of the kernel, look for the unresolved symbols
in the ELF relocation tables (just like the linker does), and put
those references into a table that is use to patch things up and you
can use standard ELF relocation code to handle this, exactly like code
we already have for module loading in the kernel already.

This idea is about 15 years old, sparc32 has been doing exactly this
via something called "btfixup" to handle the page table, TLB, and
cache differences of 15 different cpu+cache type combinations.

Please, use ELF and it's powerful and clean existing way to
do this please. :-)

Ben's case can be handled in the same way.  Just do not define the
symbols, pre-link, look for the references in the relocation tables,
and run through that when you do the set_very_readonly() or
install_paravirt_ops() thing.
