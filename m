I've finally managed to take some time to look at the series. Overall,
the concept looks good to me, and the patches look very well implemented.

The part I'm not sure about is the interface we want to end up with
at the end of the series. More on that below

I think you should have a stronger association with the 'struct
device' here. Can you replace the 'void *data' with 'struct device *dev'?

The other part I'm not completely sure about is how you want to
have MSIs map into normal IRQ descriptors. At the moment, all
MSI users are based on IRQ numbers, but this has known scalability
problems. I wonder if we can do the interface in a way that
hides the interrupt number from generic device drivers and just
passes a 'struct irq_desc'. Note that there are long-term plans to
get rid of IRQ numbers entirely, but those plans have existed for
a long time already without anybody seriously addressing the device
driver interfaces so far, so it might never really happen.

For the generic drivers, I don't see much point in differentiating between
MSI and MSI-X, as I believe the difference is something internal to the PCI
implementation.

With the other operations, I think they should all take a 'struct device *'
as the first argument for convenience and consistency. I don't think you actually
need msi_read_message(), and we could avoid msi_write_message() by doing it
the other way round.

What I'd envision as the API from the device driver perspective is something
as simple like this:

struct msi_desc *msi_request(struct msi_chip *chip, irq_handler_t handler,
			unsigned long flags, const char *name, struct device *dev);

which would get an msi descriptor that is valid for this device (dev)
connected to a particular msi_chip, and associate a handler function
with it. The device driver can call that function and retrieve the
address/message pair from the msi_desc in order to store it in its own
device specific registers. The request_irq() can be handled internally
to msi_request().

Would that work for you?
