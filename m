We can tap into those algorithms just as effectively using ballooning, and we've optimized the sharing and working set models from outside of the guest.  So while CMM gives slightly better information for a random forced page eviction, the complexity doesn't appear to justify the savings for a VMware implementation.

Things would change quite a bit if we had hardware supported per-page dirty bits.

Ballooning still works if you use a kernel based balloon driver.  Using
madvise wouldn't be a reliable way to balloon anyway.  Are you talking
about an API to manage working sets and such from userspace?
