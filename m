In an attempt to make sure that this discussion leads to
something useful, we have summarized the points raised in this
discussion and have come up with a strategy for future.
The goal of this is to find common ground between all the approaches
proposed on this mailing list.

1 Start with Satoshi's latest patches.
2 Do the following to support propotional division:
 a) Give time slices in proportion to weights (configurable
 option). We can support both priorities and weights by doing
 propotional division between requests with same priorities.
3 Schedule time slices using WF2Q+ instead of round robin.
 Test the performance impact (both throughput and jitter in latency).
4 Do the following to support the goals of 2 level schedulers:
 a) Limit the request descriptors allocated to each cgroup by adding
 functionality to elv_may_queue()
 b) Add support for putting an absolute limit on IO consumed by a
 cgroup. Such support exists in dm-ioband and is provided by Andrea
 Righi's patches too.
 c) Add support (configurable option) to keep track of total disk
time/sectors/count
 consumed at each device, and factor that into scheduling decision
 (more discussion needed here)
5 Support multiple layers of cgroups to align IO controller behavior
 with CPU scheduling behavior (more discussion?)
6 Incorporate an IO tracking approach which re-uses memory resource
controller code but is not dependent on it (may be biocgroup patches from
dm-ioband can be used here directly)
7 Start an offline email thread to keep track of progress on the above
goals.

Please feel free to add/modify items to the list
when you respond back. Any comments/suggestions are more than welcome.

Thanks.
Divyesh & Nauman
