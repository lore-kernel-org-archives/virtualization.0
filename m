I know virtio-pmem struct page can be allocated from the device itself.

But I don't think it changes too much, since guest kernel implementation
shouldn't imply anything of the host. So that the pmem and struct page
can be backed by anonymous memory or other types of memory, and it can
still cause unexpected large amount of memory on the host instead. But
allocating on the device is sightly better than allocate struct page in
the guest.

The problem is it's hard to make sure the on-demand allocation is always
successful since the guest knows nothing from the host, so that it
exposes security risks like denial-of-service or more.

If this security concern is not resolved (e.g. implement a reclaim path),
my thought is I think we shouldn't overcommit the struct page since it's
a functional defect if virtio-pmem is reasonably large.

Thanks,
Gao Xiang
