Generally there is one endpoint per domain. Linux creates the domains and
decides which endpoint goes in which domain. It puts multiple endpoints in
a domain in two cases:

* If endpoints cannot be isolated from each others by the IOMMU, for
  example if ACS isolation isn't enabled in PCIe. In that case endpoints
  are in the same IOMMU group, and therefore contained in the same domain.
  This is more of a quirk for broken hardware, and isn't much of a concern
  for virtualization because it's easy for the hypervisor to present
  endpoints isolated from each others.

* If userspace wants to put endpoints in the same VFIO container, then
  VFIO first attempts to put them in the same IOMMU domain, and falls back
  to multiple domains if that fails. That case is just a luxury and we
  shouldn't over-complicate the driver to cater for this.

So the attach checks don't need to be that complicated. Checking that the
page masks are exactly the same should be enough.

I tend to agree, it's not very likely that we'll have a configuration with
different page sizes between physical and virtual endpoints.

If there is a way for QEMU to simply reject VFIO devices that don't use
the same page mask as what's configured globally, let's do that instead of
introducing the page_size_mask property.

Realistically we're not going to have a page granule larger than 4G, it's
going to be 4k or 64k. But we can add a check that truncates the
page_size_mask to 32-bit and makes sure that it's non-null.

No it overrides the global mask

Bharat, please rename this to page_size_mask for consistency
