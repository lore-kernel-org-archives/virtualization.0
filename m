which fields are RW,RO,WO?

Given that cid is like an IP address, 32 bit seems too
limiting. I would go for a 64 bit one or maybe even 128 bit,
so that e.g. GUIDs can be used there.

I'd make this little endian.

Don't we need a field for driver to specify the # of VQs?

I note packets have no sequence numbers.
This means that a given stream should only use
a single VQ in each direction, correct?
Maybe make this explicit.

Let's make header explicitly little endian and avoid the
heartburn we have with many other transports.

Ports are 32 bit? I guess most applications can't work with >16 bit.

Also, why put cid's in all packets? They are only needed
when you create a connection, no? Afterwards port numbers
can be used.

Please add padding to align all field naturally.

Is a 64 bit counter really needed? 64 bit math
has portability limitations and performance overhead on many
architectures.

Packing produces terrible code in many compilers.
Please avoid packed structures on data path, instead,
pad structures explicitly to align all fields naturally.

It's only with VIRTIO_VSOCK_OP_SHUTDOWN - how about a generic
flags field that is interpreted depending on op?

What's the reason for a 4 stage setup? Most transports
make do with 3.
Also, at what stage can each side get/transmit packets?
What happens in case of errors at each stage?
Don't we want to distinguish between errors?
(E.g. wrong cid, no app listening on port, etc)?

This also appears to be vulnerable to a variant of
a syn flood attack (guest attacking host).
I think we need a cookie hash in there to prevent this.


Can you describe connection teardown please?
I see there are RST and SHUTDOWN messages.
What rules do they obey?
