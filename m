Hi James, 

Please let us know your views on how should we proceed on this ? In my
previous mail, I have tried to state my reservations against going the
virt-scsi way just as yet. Also please note that we emulate a pure PCI
device hence I don't see a reason why our driver should be treated any
different than a driver for a physical HBA. 

Thanks,
Alok
