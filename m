Yes that's alright, all that time when vcpu was idle and scheduled out
will anyways be accounted as idle time, as mentioned in my earlier mail
( and if my understanding is not wrong) this is handled by
tick_nohz_restart_sched_tick.

But i was talking about a case, where we have this code
	local_irq_disable()
	some_work()
	local_irq_enable()

If this some_work() executed for say 2 ticks, shouldn't the process
executing this be accounted 2 ticks of system time ? According to my
understanding, we will account a single tick for this, right ? 

I agree that this "some_work" is wrong to start with and it shouldn't
keep interrupts disabled for so long, but i am considering this case
just to understand if process_accounting needs any changes for this
case.

But getting the unstolen time is a problem, and I want to try and see if
this unstolen time can be calculated without querying the hypervisor.

Yep I did look at that code earlier, and that's how we can do it for VMI
too, (actually it was there in VMI in 2.6.21 but we removed it during
the NO_HZ merge). I am trying to see if we could do this for the non-VMI
case i.e for the native kernel case.

That's a good point, that means we might have to change the
native_sched_clock definition too to return this (rdtsc - stolen time)
value.

I am saying that we should have just one timebase, one which measures
wallclock time. I am thinking that we can calculate the unstolen time
rather than asking the hypervisor. 
As mentioned earlier

UNSTOLEN time on a cpu  = summation of kstat_cpu().cpustat variables
                          (except the steal time variable)

So we can easily get the stolen_time as...
stolen_time from a cpu = wallclock_time - Unstolen_time.

The vcpu idle time will be accounted correctly as idle time with
tick_nohz_restart_sched_tick. So I don't think we would be confusing it
ever as stolen time atleast in the NO_HZ case.

Thanks,
