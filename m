dm-rq actually uses IO scheduler at high layer, and early merge has some
benefits:

1) virtio-blk inflight requests are reduced, so less chance to throttle
inside VM, meantime less IOs(bigger size) are handled by QEMU, and submitted
to host side queue.

2) early merge in VM is cheap than host side, since there can be more block
IOs originated from different virtio-blk/scsi devices at the same time and
all images can be stored in single disk, then these IOs become interleaved in
host side queue, so sequential IO may become random or hard to merge.

As Jens mentioned, it needs actual test.


Thanks,
Ming
