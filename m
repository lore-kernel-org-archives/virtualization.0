What do you mean, it happens on real hardware today?  So far as I know,
the only cases where we have dynamic adjustment of flow steering are in
ixgbe (big table of hash filters, I think) and sfc (perfect filters).
I don't think that anyone's currently doing flow steering with the RSS
indirection table.  (At least, not on Linux.  I think that Microsoft was
intending to do so on Windows, but I don't know whether they ever did.)

Yes, that is possible.  RFS is careful to avoid such reordering by only
changing the steering of a flow when none of its packets can be in a
software receive queue.  It is not generally possible to do the same for
hardware receive queues.  However, when the first condition is met it is
likely that there won't be a whole lot of packets for that flow in the
hardware receive queue either.  (But if there are, then I think as a
side-effect of commit 09994d1 RFS will repeatedly ask the driver to
steer the flow.  Which isn't ideal.)
