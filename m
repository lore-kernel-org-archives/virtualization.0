I am talking about the qemu that was (is) shipping with Xen.  In Hyper-V,
the block devices configured as IDE devices for the guest will be taken over
by the native drivers if the PV drivers don't load first and  take over the IDE majors.
If you want to have the root device be managed by the PV drivers, this appears to be
the only way to ensure that native IDE drivers don't take over the root device. Granted,
this depends on ensuring the PV drivers load first, but I don't know if there is another way
to achieve this.

These are exactly the issues that had to be solved to have the PV 
drivers manage the root device.

By setting up appropriate modprobe rules, this can be addressed.

Agreed; I am not sure what the right solution for Hyper-V is other than 
(a) preventing the native IDE drivers from loading and (b) having
the right modprobe rules to ensure libata would not present these
same devices to the guest as scsi devices.
