Good point.  You'd need to build 64k buffers to pass to recvmmsg, then
reuse the parts it didn't touch on the next call.  This limits us to
about a 16th of what we could do with an interface which understood
buffer merging, but I don't know how much that would matter in
practice.  We'd need some benchmarks....

Cheers,
Rusty.
