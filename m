Yeah, that was my hope but I think it would be easier to enforce to
have a common function which is clearly marked legacy so that new
driver writers can go look for the naming code in the existing ones,
find out they're all using the same function which is marked legacy
and explains what to do for newer drivers.

Thanks.
