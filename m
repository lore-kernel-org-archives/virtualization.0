Yep, sorry.

But we really do want the guest to set the ring size.  Because it has to
be guest-physical-contiguous, the host currently sets a very small ring,
because the guest is useless if it can't allocate.

Either way, it's now the driver's responsibility to write those fields.

We could, for sure.

Because I suspect we'll be different enough anyway, once we change the
way we allocate the ring, and write the alignment.  It'll be *clearer*
to have two completely separate paths than to fill with if() statements.
And a rewrite won't hurt the driver.

But to be honest I don't really care about the Linux driver: we're
steeped in this stuff and we'll get it right.  But I'm *terrified* of
making the spec more complex; implementations will get it wrong.  I
*really* want to banish the legacy stuff to an appendix where noone will
ever know it's there :)

As the patch shows, I decided not to do that.  It's a nice heads-up, but
breaking older versions of the code is just mean.  Hence this:

Good point, should mark them appropriately with __le16.  That makes it
even clearer.

Thanks,
Rusty.
