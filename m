Andrea, since you looked at this design at the early stages,
maybe you can provide feedback on the following question:

vhost has an ioctl to do get_task_mm and store the mm in per-file device
structure.  mmput is called when file is closed.  vhost is careful not
to reference the mm after is has been put. There is also an atomic
mutual exclusion mechanism to ensure that vhost does not allow one
process to access another's mm, even if they share a vhost file
descriptor.  But, this still means that mm structure can outlive the
task if the file descriptor is shared with another process.

Other drivers, such as kvm, have the same property.

Do you think this is OK?

Thanks!
