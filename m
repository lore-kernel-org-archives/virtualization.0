Really?  vmxnet3_plugin.c is no supposed to use any kernel-provided
functions at all?  Then why have it in the kernel at all?  Seriously,
why?

If it's so simple, then why does it need to be separate?  Why not just
put it in your driver as-is to handle the ring-buffer logic (as that's
all it looks to be doing), and then you don't need any plugin code at
all?

It looks like you are linking this file into your "main" driver module,
so I fail to see any type of separation at all happening with this
patch.

Or am I totally missing something here?

thanks,
