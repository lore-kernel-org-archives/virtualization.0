Given the way register banking is done on AArch64, issuing an HVC on a
32-bit guest OS doesn't require translation on a 64-bit hypervisor. We
have a similar implementation at the SVC level (for 32-bit user apps on
a 64-bit kernel), the only modification was where a 32-bit SVC takes a
64-bit parameter in two separate 32-bit registers, so packing needs to
be done in a syscall wrapper.

I'm not closely involved with any of the Xen or KVM work but I would
vote for using HVC than a hypercall page.
