Could prevent preempt if pda.intr_mask is set.  preemptible() is defined as:

    # define preemptible()    (preempt_count() == 0 && !irqs_disabled())

anyway, so that would be changed to look at the intr_mask rather than
eflags.
(I'm not sure if preemptible() is actually used to determine whether
preempt or not).

Alternatively, the intr_mask could be encoded in a bit of preempt_count...
