Sure.  A common feature across all hypervisor-specific ABIs may get 
subsumed into a generic interface which is equivalent to all the 
others.  That's fine.  But nobody should expect to be able to mix 
hyperV's lazy tlb interface with KVM's pv mmu updates and expect to get 
a working result.

It should export any interface that it implements fully, but those 
interfaces may have contradictory or inconsistent semantics which 
prevent them from being used concurrently.

Well, sure.  There's two distinct issues:

   1. Using cpuid to get information about the kernel's environment.  If
      the environment is sane, then cpuid is a read-only, side-effect
      free way of getting information, and any information gathered is
      fair game.
   2. One of the pieces of information you can get with cpuid is a
      discovery of what paravirtual hypercall interfaces the environment
      supports, which the guest can compare against its list of
      interfaces that it supports.  If there's some amount of
      intersection, it can decide to use one of those interfaces.

I'm saying that *in general* a guest should expect to be able to use one 
and only one of those interfaces.  There will be explicitly defined 
exceptions to that - such as using generic ABIs in addition to 
hypervisor specific ABIs - but a guest can't expect to to be able to mix 
and match.

A tricky issue with selecting an ABI is if two hypervisors end up using 
exactly the same mechanism for implementing hypercalls (or whatever), so 
that there needs to be some explicit way for the guest to nominate which 
interface its actually using...
