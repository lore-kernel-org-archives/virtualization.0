Unconditionally for virtio-pci or unconditionally for all drivers?  I
wouldn't be surprised if some of the virtio-mmio archs have trouble,
too.  Aarch64, at least, seems to be okay with using the DMA API on
virtio_mmio devices, even with IOMMU support compiled in.

Are there other relevant architectures that are easy to test?

Sure.

The question is: should the patches go in to 3.18 as is our should
they wait?  It would be straightforward to remove the use_dma_api
switch PPC, s390, and virtio_mmio are ready.
