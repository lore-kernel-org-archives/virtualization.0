This relative simplicity is what prompted me to say that we probably
should try to disentangle the io tracking functionality from the memory
controller a bit more (of course we still should reuse as much as we can
from it). The rationale for this is that the existing I/O scheduler
would benefit from proper io tracking capabilities too, so it'd be nice
if we could have them even in non-cgroup-capable kernels.

As an aside, when the IO context of a certain IO operation is known
(synchronous IO comes to mind) I think it should be cashed in the
resulting bio so that we can do without the expensive accesses to
bio_cgroup once it enters the block layer.
