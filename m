What if we can register/override the setup_irq() from bus-driver (not sure, but may be device-driver itself). Example PCI bus-driver will provide setup_irq() (or the part of setup_irq which set address and data in h/w) by PCI bus, which configure address/data in h/w as per PCI standard. 

We in Freescale will be using MSI for the devices behind a new-bus (which is not PCI based), We have a separate bus driver for same. And this new bus driver register/provide its own address/data write function which is based on that specific bus protocol.

Thanks
