The RHEL7 code has used PV ticketlock already. RHEL7 uses a single 
kernel for all configurations. So PV ticketlock as well as Xen and KVM 
support was compiled in. I think booting the kernel on bare metal will 
cause the Xen code to work in HVM mode thus activating the PV spinlock 
code which has a negative impact on performance. That may be why it was 
disabled so that the bare metal performance will not be impacted.

BTW, could you send me more information about the configuration of the 
machine, like the .config file that you used?
