I really think it's best to start with 256 alignment.
A bit simpler, better than what we had, and will let us go
above PAGE_SIZE long term.  The optimization shrinking
alignment to 64 can be done on top if we see a
work-load that's improved by it, which I doubt.

You can just do len * MERGEABLE_BUFFER_ALIGN too - my compiler seems
to be smart enough to see it's same.
This way there's no need for MERGEABLE_BUFFER_SHIFT

uintptr_t? or just unsigned long ...

The APIs are a bit inconsistent in naming.
Also it's unfortunate that we use void * for both virtio buffer
and frame memory.

How about
	mergeable_buf_to_len
	mergeable_buf_to_page
	mergeable_buf_to_offset
	mergeable_page_to_buf

this way we don't use void * for frame memory.

alternatively, cast virtio buffer to unsigned long
immediately and pass that around everywhere.
