Sure. This is not sufficient for a complete solution, but is Qemu the right place
to manage primary/standby interfaces?

I think the other steps including plugging/unplugging the primary interface needs
to handled by some orchestration layer.

Yes. Isn't this possible today when a VM is started with a mis-configured domain
XML file that passes a virtio-net interface and a VF with the same MAC?

The primary can be plugged/unplugged at any time by the management layer. So
i guess this needs to be handled in the libvirt layer.

Are you suggesting an extension to Qemu to add another flag for
primary device too?
