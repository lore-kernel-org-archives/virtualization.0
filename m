Hi Linus,
This is exactly same code as my previous pull sent earlier, the diffstat
was wrong however, I did a merge with master which fixed that.  And I
forgot to copy you so you likely
did not see it at all :(
Here comes.

The following changes since commit 5a148af66932c31814e263366094b5812210b501:

  Merge branch 'next' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/benh/powerpc (2013-05-02 10:16:16 -0700)

  Merge branch 'vhost' into 'master' (2013-05-02 22:40:01 +0300)

vhost: cleanups and fixes for 3.10

Here are vhost cleanups and fixes by Asias He and myself.
They affect both vhost-net and vhost-scsi devices.
They also *depend* on both net-next and target-pending,
where the net and target commits these changes depend on
are already merged.
So merging through the common vhost tree.
Note2: I had to make a merge from vhost into master otherwise
request-pull generates a wrong diffstat.
It's harmless since git merge will figure it all out
easily.
