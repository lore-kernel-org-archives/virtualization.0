From reading your v1 cover letter (the description appears missing in
v2) I see what you are talking about with respect to virtio-mem.

So I will count virt-io mem as something different.

Reading this and your patch cover letters again my concern is that
the justification seems to be letting the tail wag the dog.

You want kexec-tools to behave in a certain way so you are changing the
kernel.

Rather it should be change the kernel to clearly reflect reality and if
you can get away without a change to kexec-tools that is a bonus.

I am not certain, but Andrew Morton deliberately added that
firmware_map_add_hotplug call.  Which means that there is a reason
for putting hotplugged memory in the firmware map.

So the justification needs to take that reason into account.  The
justification can not be it is hotplugged therefore it should not belong
in the firmware memory map.  Unless you can show that
firmware_map_add_hotplug that was actually a bug and should be removed.
But as it has been that way since 2010 that seems like a long shot.

So my question is what is right for the firmware map?

Why does the firmware map support hotplug entries?

Once we have the answers to those questions we can figure out what logic
the special kinds of memory hotplug need.
