#2 is odd.  The shutdown bits are sticky so they cannot be cleared once
set.  I would have expected just #1 and #3.  The behavior you observe
look like a bug.

The spec text does not convey the meaning of OP_SHUTDOWN well.
OP_SHUTDOWN SHUTDOWN_TX|SHUTDOWN_RX means no further rx/tx is possible
for this connection.  "there are no more virtqueue buffers pending the
socket" really means that this isn't an immediate close from the
perspective of the application.  If the application still has unread rx
buffers then the socket stays readable until the rx data has been fully
read.

=46rom the vhost point of view each netns should have its own AF_VSOCK
namespace.  This way two containers could act as "the host" (CID 2) for
their respective guests.
