Could we not put the $steal_time+16 displacement as an immediate in the
cmpb and save a whole register here?

That way we'd end up with something like:

asm("
push %rdi;
movslq %edi, %rdi;
movq __per_cpu_offset(,%rdi,8), %rax;
cmpb $0, %[offset](%rax);
setne %al;
pop %rdi;
" : : [offset] "i" (((unsigned long)&steal_time) + offsetof(struct steal_time, preempted)));

And if we could get rid of the sign extend on edi we could avoid all the
push-pop nonsense, but I'm not sure I see how to do that (then again,
this asm foo isn't my strongest point).

Yeah it should be well possible to pass that in. But ideally we'd have
GCC grow something like __attribute__((callee_saved)) or somesuch and it
would do all this for us.

People still use Xen? ;-) In any case, their implementation looks very
similar and could easily crib this.

This is because of that noinline, right? Otherwise it would've been
folded and register pressure would be much higher.

I suspect GCC is being clever and since all this is static it plays
games with the calling convention and pushes these clobbers out.
