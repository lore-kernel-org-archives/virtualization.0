I don't completely agree:

1 - VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM is a property of the "other side", ie qemu
for example. It indicates that the peer bypasses the normal platform
iommu. The platform code in the guest has no real way to know that this
is the case, this is a specific "feature" of the qemu implementation.

2 - VIRTIO_F_PLATFORM_DMA (or whatever you want to call it), is a
property of the guest platform itself (not qemu), there's no way the
"peer" can advertize it via the virtio negociated flags. At least for
us. I don't know for sure whether that would be workable for the ARM
case. In our case, qemu has no idea at VM creation time that the VM
will turn itself into a secure VM and thus will require bounce
buffering for IOs (including virtio).

So unless we have another hook for the arch code to set
VIRTIO_F_PLATFORM_DMA on selected (or all) virtio devices from the
guest itself, I don't see that as a way to deal with it.
