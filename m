Hi all:

This series tries to add basic busy polling for vhost net. The idea is
simple: at the end of tx/rx processing, busy polling for new tx added
descriptor and rx receive socket for a while. The maximum number of
time (in us) could be spent on busy polling was specified ioctl.

Test were done through:

- 50 us as busy loop timeout
- Netperf 2.6
- Two machines with back to back connected ixgbe
- Guest with 1 vcpu and 1 queue

Results:
- For stream workload, ioexits were reduced dramatically in medium
  size (1024-2048) of tx (at most -39%) and almost all rx (at most
  -79%) as a result of polling. This compensate for the possible
  wasted cpu cycles more or less. That porbably why we can still see
  some increasing in the normalized throughput in some cases.
- Throughput of tx were increased (at most 105%) expect for the huge
  write (16384). And we can send more packets in the case (+tpkts were
  increased).
- Very minor rx regression in some cases.
- Improvemnt on TCP_RR (at most 16%).

Changes from V2:
- poll also at the end of rx handling
- factor out the polling logic and optimize the code a little bit
- add two ioctls to get and set the busy poll timeout
- test on ixgbe (which can give more stable and reproducable numbers)
  instead of mlx4.

Changes from V1:
- Add a comment for vhost_has_work() to explain why it could be
  lockless
- Add param description for busyloop_timeout
- Split out the busy polling logic into a new helper
- Check and exit the loop when there's a pending signal
- Disable preemption during busy looping to make sure lock_clock() was
  correctly used.

Jason Wang (3):
  vhost: introduce vhost_has_work()
  vhost: introduce vhost_vq_more_avail()
  vhost_net: basic polling support
