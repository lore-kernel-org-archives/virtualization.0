Converting to fb_defio made xen-fbfront quite a bit simpler and much
more maintainable.  Excellent match.

It took me a bit of time to find your fix, mostly because I assumed my
own code was broken, not fb_defio.  It's best not to make assumptions
about who uses your code; if it's any good, chances are somebody will
find a use you never imagined.
