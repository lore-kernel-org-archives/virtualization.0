There is a GIGANTIC reason to have the wait queue on tfile.

If you open a file, and do ip link del tapN you can still
be blocked waiting in poll.

The problem is specifically free_poll_entry, where we call
remove_wait_queue and fput without calling any file methods.
So all of this happens without struct tun_file's count being
elevated.  Which means tun_net_uninit can detach before we get
off of the stupid poll wait queue.

As documented in:

commit b2430de37ef0bc0799ffba7b5219d38ca417eb76

    tun: Move read_wait into tun_file
    
    The poll interface requires that the waitqueue exist while the struct
    file is open.  In the rare case when a tun device disappears before
    the tun file closes we fail to provide this property, so move
    read_wait.
    
    This is safe now that tun_net_xmit is atomic with tun_detach.

I specifically moved the wait queue out of tun struct to avoid this
race.

I will see about getting the vfs to do something saner in my generic
revoke work.  But for 2.6.30 we have to live with the nasties that
are there.
