Sorry, yes its on ovs-dev.

There does seem to be flow control in the non-mirrored case.
So I suspect its occurring at the skb level but that breaks down when
a clone occurs. It would seem that fragment level flow control would
help this problem (which is basically what Xen's netback/netfront has),
but by this point I am speculating wildly.  I'll try and find out exactly
where the problem is occurring in order for us to have a more informed
discussion.
