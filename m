I do have some concern about this call site patching mechanism as the 
modification is not atomic. The spin_unlock() calls are in many places 
in the kernel. There is a possibility that a thread is calling a certain 
spin_unlock call site while it is being patched by another one with the 
alternative() function call.

So far, I don't see any problem with bare metal where 
paravirt_patch_insns() is used to patch it to the move instruction. 
However, in a virtual guest enivornment where paravirt_patch_call() was 
used, there were situations where the system panic because of page fault 
on some invalid memory in the kthread. If you look at the 
paravirt_patch_call(), you will see:

     :
b->opcode = 0xe8; /* call */
b->delta = delta;

If another CPU reads the instruction at the call site at the right 
moment, it will get the modified call instruction, but not the new delta 
value. It will then jump to a random location. I believe that was 
causing the system panic that I saw.

So I think it is kind of risky to use it here unless we can guarantee 
that call site patching is atomic wrt other CPUs.

We use the regular paravirt call patching to switch between:

  native_queue_spin_lock_slowpath()	__pv_queue_spin_lock_slowpath()
  native_queue_spin_unlock()		__pv_queue_spin_unlock()

We use a callee saved call for the unlock function which reduces the
i-cache footprint and allows 'inlining' of SPIN_UNLOCK functions
again.

We further optimize the unlock path by patching the direct call with a
"movb $0,%arg1" if we are indeed using the native unlock code. This
makes the unlock code almost as fast as the !PARAVIRT case.

This significantly lowers the overhead of having
CONFIG_PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS enabled, even for native code.
