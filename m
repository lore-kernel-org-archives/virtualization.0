Well, the thing is, we *want* them to bypass the IOMMU for performance
reasons in the long run. Today we have no ways to tell our guests that
a PCI bus doesn't have an IOMMU, they always do !

Also qemu can mix and match devices on a given PCI bus so making this a
bus property wouldn't work either.

Any reason why this can't be a virtio capability ?

Cheers,
