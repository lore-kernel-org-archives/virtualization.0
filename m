Do you know what's the possible reason of this error?


I got from your comments from other mail.
"
Hum, interesting. So 'Free blocks count wrong' and 'Free inodes count
wrong' messages are harmless - those entries and updated only
opportunistically and on mount and generally do not have to match on live
filesystem. The other three errors regarding inode and directory count are
a fallout from aborted inode deletion. Most importantly there is *no
problem* whatsoever with block bitmaps. So it was either some memory glitch
(bitflip in the counter or the bitmap) or there is some race and bb_free
can get out of sync with the bitmap and I don't see how that could happen
especially so early after mount... Strange.
"

there is such error:
Block bitmap differences:  -(86016--87039)

Thanks
