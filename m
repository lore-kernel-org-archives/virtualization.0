Would be good to have something here, even if it's preliminary.

Who's ack do we need for that part?

Not sure about default y? At least until we've got a better idea of the
perf impact on a range of small/big new/old systems.

Would be nice if we could give a range for "lots".

The 2nd line spits a warning about a redundant entry. I think you want
to just drop it.
