One simple question there, trying to understand the usage of DESC_WRAP flag.

DESC_WRAP bit is a new flag since v2. It's used to address 'non power-of-2 ring sizes' mentioned in v2?

Being confused by the statement of wrap-around bit here, it's an internal wrap-around counter represented by single bit (0/1)?
DESC_WRAP can appear on any descriptor entry in the ring, why it highlights changing value at the beginning of the ring?

Device uses this field to detect change of wrap-around boundary by driver?

Driver uses this field to detect change of wrap-around boundary by device?

By using this, driver doesn't need to maintain any internal wrap-around count, but being aware of wrap-around by DESC_WRAP flag.


Thanks,
