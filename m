I really would like to move page_cgroup to new cgroup when the process moves...
But it's just in my plan and I'm not sure I can do it or not.

Anyway what's next for me is
 1. fix current discussion to remove page->page_cgroup pointer.
 2. reduce locks.
 3. support swap and swap-cache.

I think algorithm for (1), (2) is now getting smart.

Thanks,
