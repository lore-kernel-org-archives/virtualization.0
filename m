2nd try. I somehow enable html on the last post

If I look at the current implementation (lguest) no interrupt is sent if
there is not buffer available, no?
On the other hand, if the host does send an interrupt when no buffer is
available, this is also no problem. Looking at virtnet_poll, it seems it
can cope with an empty ring.

That would also work. We already have VRING_AVAIL_F_NO_INTERRUPT in
virtio_ring.c - maybe we can use that. Its hidden in callback and
restart handling, what about adding an explicit startup?

Ok, didnt know that. At the moment I can live with my private patch
while we work on a final solution. Meanwhile I will try to debug virtio
on SMP guests - I still see some strange races on our test system. (But
block and net is now working on s390 and can cope with medium load. )
