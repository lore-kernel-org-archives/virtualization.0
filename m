I suggest the following easy fix: as you say, it's
in one place with a bug comment.

/* On the host side we often communicate to untrusted
 * entities over virtio, so set __user tag on addresses
 * we get helps make sure we don't directly dereference the addresses,
 * while making it possible to pass the addresses in iovec arrays
 * without casts.
 */
#define __virtio __user

/* A helper to discard __virtio tag - only call when
 * you are communicating to a trusted entity.
 */
static inline void *virtio_raw_addr(__virtio void *addr)
{
	return (__force void *)addr;
}

Hmm?
