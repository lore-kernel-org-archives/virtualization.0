That's an interesting issue, thanks for pointing this out, Laurent! So
do we now rather want to leave everything as it currently is, in case
somebody wants to use vhost-net with a cross-endian TCG guest one day?

Or do we assume that either
a) TCG is so slow anyway that nobody wants to accelerate it with vhost
or
b) TCG vhost likely won't happen that soon so we hope that everybody
will already be using virtio 1.0 at that point in time (with a fixed
endianness) 
?
... then I think we should go on and include this patch.

 Thomas
