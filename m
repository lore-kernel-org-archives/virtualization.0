Rusty and Michael, what's the status of this?

I think that (aside from the trivial DMI/DMA typo) the only real issue
here is that the situation on PPC is ugly.  We're failing to enable
physical virtio hardware on PPC with these patches, but that never
worked anyway.  I don't think that there are any regressions other
than ugliness.

My preference would be to apply the patches as is (or with "DMA"
spelled correctly), and then to:

 - Make sure that all virtio-mmio systems have working DMA ops so that
virtio-mmio can the DMA API

 - Fix the DMA API on s390 (probably easy) and on PPC (not necessarily so easy)

 - Remove the non-DMA-API code, which would be a very small change on
top of these patches.
