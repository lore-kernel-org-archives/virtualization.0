This series passes a short locktorture test when based on top of current
tip/core/locking.  This is for both the first three patches and for the
full set, though in the latter case it took me an embarrassingly large
number of tries to get PARAVIRT_UNFAIR_LOCKS set properly.

Again, don't read too much into this.  This was in an 8-CPU KVM guest
on x86 (though with an interfering kernel build running on the host),
and as noted earlier, locktorture is still a bit on the lame side.
