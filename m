BTW, it's impossible for shared DAX entries (like the current XFS DAX
with reflink and EROFS will support this feature later too for chunk
memory sharing), since you cannot just use mapping and index to get
the VMA like page cache does unless you invent another new mechanism
for this.

Reclaiming page entry mechanism seems it can be used for or overlapped
to another types of memory (in order to save struct page memory in
general): I'm not sure if it needs wider discussion on reclaiming
"struct page" in general first.

Anyway, it'd be better to get some numbers with RL or agent workloads
(especially the host memory is under reasonable pressure) before
landing all these new infras upstream if proceeding in this way.

Thanks,
