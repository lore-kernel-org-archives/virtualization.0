Ah, I stand corrected, you are right. I had this recollection that the 
prepare and kick where separate before as well, but apparently just bad 
memory.

I tend to agree. But I think this one is simple enough to warrant doing 
it, when the performance increase is as large as it is.

In principle, pushing the patch to stable definitely isn't an issue with 
the stable crew. And yes, they apparently do want more stuff. If you 
look at it from the distro side, having a stable(r) repository is a no 
brainer. And they'd want to pick this patch anyway, so...
