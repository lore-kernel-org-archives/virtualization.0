virtqueue_add_buf could be slower if it used the new API.  That's
because of the overhead of writing and reading from struct
virtqueue_buf, instead of using variables in registers.

Makes sense, I'll try.  However, note that I *do* need the
infrastructure in this patch because virtio-scsi could never use a
hypothetical virtqueue_add_buf_single; requests always have at least 2
buffers for the headers.

However I could add virtqueue_add_sg_single and use it for those
headers.  The I/O buffer can keep using virtqueue_add_sg.
