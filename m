We assumed that PCI config space has a static layout like most other
devices. Having a behavior of "First bit 20 does something, but after
enabling MSI-X it does something completely different" sounds strange.

I'm wondering why offsets of the config structure change during run time
and are not statically defined when the device is started.

It's not like VIRTIO_F_FEATURES_HI can be disabled after it was enabled,
or MSI-X can be simply disabled during run time.

Maybe this is better solved by copying the way it was done in PCI itself
with capability linked list?
