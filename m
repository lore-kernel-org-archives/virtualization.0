Not quite what I meant.  A minimal host can reasonably expect ethernet-fitting
packets.  If it supports GSO of course it must handle larger ones.  Otherwise
we should add YA feature bit or even a max-mtu field.

So, I was thinking something like this over your patch (I also removed the
used-once MAX and MIN definitions; I dislike gratuitous indirection):

 }
