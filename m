Since the request comes from a VM, we always take the "skip" path,
regardless of the topology.

I won't worry for hypervisors, they have enough brilliant developers to
take the upstream code to their codebase.

This is not correct, at least for mlx5 devices. The need was already recognized
in 2020 in commit 90da7dc8206a ("RDMA/mlx5: Support dma-buf based userspace
memory region").

This is a very Intel-centric view. The vast majority of systems probably run on ARM
and use QEMU.

The primary goal of HMAT is to eliminate the need for whitelists and to
simulate a P2P route for the VM that accounts for the hypervisor topology.
Latency and bandwidth are secondary considerations.

Thanks
