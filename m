After reading more about this, I am not convinced this should be part
of the bridge code. The bridge code really consists of two parts:
forwarding table and optional spanning tree. Well the VEPA code
short circuits both of these; it can't imagine it working
with STP turned on. The only part of bridge code that really gets
used by this are the receive packet hooks and the crufty old
API.

So instead of adding more stuff to existing bridge code, why not
have a new driver for just VEPA. You could
do it with a simple version of macvlan type driver.
