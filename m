Ok.

It is needed to decide whether to use an indirect or a direct buffer.
The idea is to avoid a memory allocation if the driver is providing us
with separate sg elements (under the assumption that they will be few).

Originally I wanted to use a mix of direct and indirect buffer (direct
if add_buf received a one-element scatterlist, otherwise indirect).  It
would have had the same effect, without having to specify count_sg in
advance.  The spec is not clear if that is allowed or not, but in the
end they do not work with either QEMU or vhost, so I chose this
alternative instead.
