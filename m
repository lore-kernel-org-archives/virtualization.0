Hi Rusty,

Yeah, it's unfortunate for poor old userspace.

Ok, I'll split this patch in two since I think that only 9p has the
zero-copy stuff, which is why an extra fix is needed there for creating the
scatterlist correctly.

Tell me about it...

I've not measured it, but even when you don't have CONFIG_HIGHMEM, there's
going to be an overhead here because we go around the houses to get the page
and then add the offset on afterwards. I doubt it's something we want to
plumb directly into virt_to_phys (also, kmap_to_page may call virt_to_phys via
the __pa macro so we'd get stuck).

Hmm, that will probably work for the vring but the zero-copy code for 9p may
just give us an address from userspace if I'm understanding it correctly. In
that case, we really have to do the translation as below (which is actually
much cleaner because everything is page-aligned).

So what do you reckon? How about I leave this hunk as a separate patch and
have a play masking out __GFP_HIGHMEM for the vring descriptor?

Cheers,
