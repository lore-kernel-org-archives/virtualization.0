One reason is that, even though in practice I expect roughly the same
number of targets and VCPUs, hotplug means the number of targets is
difficult to predict and is usually fixed to 256.

The other reason is that per-target vq didn't give any performance
advantage.  The bonus comes from cache locality and less process
migrations, more than from the independent virtqueues.
