Why only IPv4?

This is not a proper implementation of ndo_rx_flow_steer.  If you steer
a flow by changing the RSS table this can easily cause packet reordering
in other flows.  The filtering should be more precise, ideally matching
exactly a single flow by e.g. VID and IP 5-tuple.

I think you need to add a second hash table which records exactly which
flow is supposed to be steered.  Also, you must call
rps_may_expire_flow() to check whether an entry in this table may be
replaced; otherwise you can cause packet reordering in the flow that was
previously being steered.

Finally, this function must return the table index it assigned, so that
rps_may_expire_flow() works.

Don't do this, let XPS handle it.
