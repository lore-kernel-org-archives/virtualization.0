I agree here. Still trying to understand whether we can agree to use
a feature bit for this, or not.

But this isn't a virtio-pci only issue, is it?
qemu has s390 bus with same limmitation.
How can we tie it to pci layout?

Maybe what you mean is to use a transport feature for this
and tie *that* to new layout in case of pci?
