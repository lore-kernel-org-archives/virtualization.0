But it that is what we want to reduce.

So something like this patch should be done in virtio core somewhere
else. Virtio-net can not do this since it does not have the knowledge of
event index.

This is just what we want I think. The interrupt was not lost but fired
after 3/4 pending buffers were consumed. Do you see any real issue on this?

In the previous reply you said you're using
virtuqueue_enable_cb_delayed(), so no race in your patch.
