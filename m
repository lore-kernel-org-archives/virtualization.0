I will try to use "struct device" infrastructure, thanks for your suggestion. :)

Yes, I almost agree if we won't change the existing hundreds of drivers, what
I worried about is some drivers may want to know the IRQ numbers, and use the IRQ
number to process different things, as I mentioned in another reply.
But we can also provide the interface which integrate MSI configuration and request_irq(),
if most drivers don't care the IRQ number.

OK, I got it.

I mean platform device drivers, because we can find the target msi_chip by some platform
interfaces(like the existing of_pci_find_msi_chip_by_node()). So we no need to explicitly provide
the msi_chip as the function argument.

Yes, agree.

Yes, the best way to tell the kernel which msi_chip should deliver to is describe
the binding in DTS file. If a real degenerate case found, we can update the platform
interface which is responsible for getting the match msi_chip in future.
