That was actually what I was going to do until I thought about it a bit
more and discussed it with Herbert.

The virtio_net MTU only affects the transmit path, so there shouldn't be
any issue with a host that doesn't support those features.

The MTU on the receive path is a different story - e.g. the host needs
to have a large enough buffer when reading from the tap fd and the guest
needs to have allocated large enough receive buffers. The former we
fixed recently in KVM (we used to only have a 64k buffer if built with
IFF_VNET_HDR support) and the latter is currently only true if either
GSO or MRG_RXBUF has been negotiated.

So, in summary - making change_mtu() check for GSO and MRG_RXBUF isn't
correct, but perhaps we could do it anyway so as to give the user a hint
that a large MTU isn't going to work on the receive path. If you feel
that's best, here's another version.

Cheers,
Mark.

Subject: [PATCH] virtio_net: large tx MTU support

We don't really have a max tx packet size limit, so allow configuring
the device with up to 64k tx MTU.

On the receive path, we can only handle a large MTU if we negotiate
GSO or MRG_RXBUF with the host. In order to give the user some hint
as to this limitation, we also limit the transmit path to a smaller
MTU if neither of those features are available.
