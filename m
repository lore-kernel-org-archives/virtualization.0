I am aware of that when I was trying to add the hash table debug code, 
but I want to get the code out for review and so hasn't made any change 
yet. I have just done testing by adding some debug code to check the 
hashing efficiency. With the kernel build workload, with over 1M calls 
to pv_hash(), all of them get an empty entry on the first try. Maybe the 
minimum hash table size of 256 helps.

This should not be a big problem. I just need to add a check at the end 
of the for loop that if hash is 0, change it to a certain non-0 value 
instead of calling lfsr().

As for ditching the lfsr idea, I am fine with that. So there will be 4 
entries (1 cacheline) for each hash value. If all the entries are full, 
we proceed to the next cacheline.  Right?
