Oh.  I thought linux-next is pulling vhost-next, when in fact
it turns out it's pulling it's own linux-next branch.

So it looks like I didn't update that branch in a while - now I see
why it's a bit so quiet.

It's probably best to keep it at linux-next branch, as it is:
I've tweaked my push rules to update that branch now, and pushed
again.

Thanks a lot for letting me know!

You are right of course.
