As I said in the paragraph above the code that potentially holds the
mutex for long time is the thread in hwrng core: hwrng_fillfn(). As it
calls rng_get_data() with "wait" argument == 1 it may block while
holding reading_mutex, which, in turn, will block rng_dev_read(), even
if it was called with O_NONBLOCK.
