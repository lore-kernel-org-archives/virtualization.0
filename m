I agree that what you proposed is the most straightforward approach.
Ryo and I have also investigated the CFQ scheduler that It will be possible
to enhance it to support bandwidth control with quite a few modification.
I think both approach have pros and cons.

At this time, we have chosen the device-mapper approach because:
 - it can work with any I/O scheduler. Some people will want use the NOOP
   scheduler against high-end storages.
 - only people who need I/O bandwidth control should use it.
 - it is independent to the I/O schedulers so that it will be easy to maintain.
 - it can keep the CFQ implementation simple.

The current the CFQ scheduler has some limitations if you want to control the
bandwidths. The scheduler only has seven priority levels, which also means it
has only seven classes. If you assign the same io-priority A to several VMs
--- virtual machines ---, these machines have to share the I/O bandwidth which
is assign to the io-priority A class. If other VM with io-priority B which is
lower than io-priority A and there is no other VM in the same io-priority B
class, VM in the io-priority B class may be able to use large bandwidth than
VMs in io-priority the A class.

I guess two level scheduling should be introduced in the CFQ scheduler if needed.
The one is to choose the best cgroup or job, and the other is to choose the
highest io-priority class.

There is another limitation that io-priority is global so that it affects
all the disks to access. It isn't allowed to have a job use several io-priorities
to access several disks respectively. I think "per disk io-priority" will be
required.

But the device-mapper approach also has a bad points.
It is hard to get the capabilities and configurations of the underlying devices
such as information of partitions or LUNs. So some configuration tools may
probably be required.

Thank you,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
