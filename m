OK I'm in that situation again. I have some vhost-net patches that depend on
changes in tip.
But I also have a vhost-next branch with unrelated changes, that
I started from -rc3.

Previously I would just merge tip into vhost-next, then everyone's
happy, but it will create an implicit back-merge again, won't it?

So what should I do?

Sorry about being dense.
