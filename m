For a simple madvise-based implementation such as the one in QEMU, the
host doesn't need to be told about anything (except periodic updating of
the "actual" field, or the statsq).

The guest doesn't need at all to use the deflateq in fact.

Cool.

Yes, of course.

Silent deflate is deflating just by using the page, without using the
deflateq at all.  So it can be done even from GFP_ATOMIC context.

But knowing that the guest will _not_ deflate silently also benefits the
host. This is the cause of unpinning ballooned pages and pinning them
again upon deflation. This allows cooperative memory overcommit even if
the guests' memory is pinned, similar to what Xen did before it
supported overcommit.  This is the second feature bit.

There are three cases:

* guest will never do silent deflation: current Linux driver.  Host may
do munlock/mlock dance.  Negotiates VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_WILL_TELL_HOST
only, features = VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_WILL_TELL_HOST.

* guest will always do silent deflation: current Windows driver.
Negotiates nothing, or if it cares it can negotiate
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_SILENT_DEFLATE.  Host mustn't do munlock/mlock dance.

* guest may do silent deflation if available: combo of Linux driver +
Frank's driver.  Negotiates both features, looks at
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_SILENT_DEFLATE host feature to decide how to behave:

  ** If PCI passthrough, the host will not negotiate
     VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_SILENT_DEFLATE.  The driver will behave as the
     current Linux driver, the host can do the munlock/mlock dance.

  ** If no PCI passthrough, the host will negotiate
     VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_SILENT_DEFLATE, and the driver can balloon more
     aggressively and not use the deflateq.
