Well, perhaps, let's not get ahead of ourselves here :)

The issue I am referring to above still has to do with the vmbus core.

The goal is to have the vmbus work like all other busses in the kernel.
You register a hv_driver with some probe and disconnect callbacks, and
the vmbus calls into the drivers when it needs to.

You are almost there, using the struct device pointers directly, but a
few more steps remain.

I'll look into the details after your remaining cleanups, I don't want
to get in the way of them.

thanks,
