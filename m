This is fundamental in any solution. Guest/application can not
write over a memory buffer as long as hardware might be reading it.

We can allow out of order, no guests that follow virtio spec
will break. But this won't help in all cases
- a single slow flow can occupy the whole ring, you will not
  be able to make any new buffers available for the fast flow
- what host considers a single flow can be multiple flows for guest

There are many other examples.

This talk of potential deadlock confuses me - I think you mean we would
deadlock if we did not orphan skbs in !use_napi - is that right?  If you
mean that you can drop skb orphan and this won't lead to a deadlock if
free skbs upon a tx interrupt, I agree, for sure.

The issue is that holding onto buffers for very long times makes guests
think they are stuck. This is funamentally because from guest point of
view this is a NIC, so it is supposed to transmit things out in
a timely manner. If host backs the virtual NIC by something that is not
a NIC, with traffic shaping etc introducing unbounded latencies,
guest will be confused.

For example, we could set ndo_tx_timeout within guest. Then
if tx queue is stopped for too long, a watchdog would fire.

We worked around most of the issues by introducing guest/host
copy. This copy, done by vhost-net, allows us to pretend that
a not-nic backend (e.g. a qdisc) is a nic (virtio-net).
This way you can both do traffic shaping in host with
unbounded latencies and limit latency from guest point of view.

Cost is both data copies and loss of end to end credit accounting.

Changing Linux as a host to limit latencies while not doing copies will
not be an easy task but that's the only fix that comes to mind.
