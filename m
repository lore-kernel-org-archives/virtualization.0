No, that's the point ("break the guest" is really "break the driver").

Agreed.

Idle guests can move cache pages to the balloon.  You can overcommit
more aggressively, because the host can madvise away a lot more memory.

Hmm, then I'm not sure I follow yours.  We agreed that delaying
notifications or skipping them is really the same thing, right?

I think we're just stuck in a linguistic problem, with "must not" being
wrong and "does not have to" being too verbose.  Calling it
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_SILENT_DEFLATE was a workaround for this, but perhaps
it adds more confusion.
