There are two requirements pulling at this patch series, but I agree
that we need to clarify them.

When dom0 loads a crash kernel, it is loading one for Xen to use.  As a
dom0 crash causes a Xen crash, having dom0 set up a kdump kernel for
itself is completely useless.  This ability is present in "classic Xen
dom0" kernels, but the feature is currently missing in PVOPS.

Many cloud customers and service providers want the ability for a VM
administrator to be able to load a kdump/kexec kernel within a
domain[1].  This allows the VM administrator to take more proactive
steps to isolate the cause of a crash, the state of which is most likely
discarded while tearing down the domain.  The result being that as far
as Xen is concerned, the domain is still alive, while the kdump
kernel/environment can work its usual magic.  I am not aware of any
feature like this existing in the past.
