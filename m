After considering this problem deeper, I decide to say NO against
to your opinion. IMHO, the LTO is just an optimization, on the other
hand, NOKPROBE_SYMBOL is more important because it is for avoiding
kernel crash. I mean, the safety and stability should be prior to
the performance. Anyway, such side-effect of NOKPROBE_SYMBOL looks
very limited. Perhaps, less than 1% of functions will be marked.
How much does it affect for the optimization?

Thank you,
