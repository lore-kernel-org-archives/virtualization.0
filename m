I will go with hid-hv  if there are no objections.

In the chain of trust, the hypervisor and the host are the foundations
as far as the guest is concerned, since both the hypervisor and the host
can affect the guest in ways that the guest has no obvious way to protect itself.
If the hypervisor/host have security holes, there is not much you can do in the guest
to deal with it. 
In this case, I can add checks but I am not sure how useful it is.

I am not sure what you are recommending here Greg; the host mandates that
we exit this loop only when there is nothing more to be read; that exit path is in the
current code. If we exit this code for any other reason (such as based on a timeout)
we will not be awakened by the host when in fact there is data to be read.
