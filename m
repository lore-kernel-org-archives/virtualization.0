I think you figured this out while I was sleeping, but just to confirm:

 1. The MIPS64 ISA doc [1] talks about SYNC in a way that applies only
    to memory accesses appearing in *program-order* before the SYNC

 2. We need WRC+sync+addr to work, which means that the SYNC in P1 must
    also capture the store in P0 as being "before" the barrier. Leonid
    reckons it works, but his explanation [2] focussed on the address
    dependency in P2 as to why this works. If that is the case (i.e.
    address dependency provides global transitivity), then WRC+addr+addr
    should also work (even though its not required).

 3. It seems that WRC+addr+addr doesn't work, so I'm still suspicious
    about WRC+sync+addr, because neither the architecture document or
    Leonid's explanation tell me that it should be forbidden.
