That's correct, VMCI is wired into vSockets and we don't currently
provide any way to insert another transport.

Sorry, that was a bad explanation on my part.  You're absolutely
correct as to how it _should_ work.  But it's up to Red Hat or others
to get the ball rolling and motivate the necessary work on vSockets
to make this happen.  As Greg says, "everyone is lazy and just wants
their code accepted" ;)

Thanks!
