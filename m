Hmm this means the testing wasn't successful then, as you said:

	The idea was to get it 100% loaded, so we can see that the polling is
	getting it to produce higher throughput.

in fact here you are producing more throughput but spending more power
to produce it, which can have any number of explanations besides polling
improving the efficiency. For example, increasing system load might
disable host power management.
