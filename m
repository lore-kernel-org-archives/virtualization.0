Well, that was my point: virtio can already work on a number of abstractions,
so adding one more for vhost should not be too hard.

The trick is to swap the virtqueues instead. virtio-net is actually
mostly symmetric in just the same way that the physical wires on a
twisted pair ethernet are symmetric (I like how that analogy fits).

virtio_net kicks the transmit virtqueue when it has data and
it kicks the receive queue when it has empty buffers to fill,
and it has callbacks when the two are done. You can do the
same in both the guest and the host, but then the guests input
virtqueue is the hosts output virtqueue and vice versa.

Once a virtqueue got kicked from both sides, the vhost_virtqueue
implementation between the two only needs to do a copy_from_user
or copy_to_user (possibly from a thread if it is in atomic context)
and then call the two callback functions. This is basically the
same thing you do already, except that you use slightly different
names for the components.
