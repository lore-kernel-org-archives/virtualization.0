Hi Eric !

Thanks for the advice. I had thought about the socket buffer but at som=
e
point it slipped my mind.

In any case the following patch seems to implement the change that I ha=
d in
mind. However my discussions Michael Tsirkin elsewhere in this thread a=
re
beginning to make me think that think that perhaps this change isn't th=
e
best solution.

diff --git a/datapath/actions.c b/datapath/actions.c

I got a rather nasty panic without the if (skb->sk),
I guess some skbs don't have a socket.
