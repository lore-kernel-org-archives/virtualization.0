The problem here is that in some of the problematic cases the virtio
driver may not even be loaded.  If someone runs an L1 guest with an
IOMMU-bypassing virtio device and assigns it to L2 using vfio, then
*boom* L1 crashes.  (Same if, say, DPDK gets used, I think.)

I'd suggest that, in the absence of the new DT binding, we assume that
any PCI device with the virtio vendor ID is passthrough on powerpc.  I
can do this in the virtio driver, but if it's in the platform code
then vfio gets it right too (i.e. fails to load).
