Absolutely. For MIPS R2 which is not Octeon.

I don't know. I would like to have responses. Ralf asked Maciej about 
old systems and that came nowhere. Even rewrite - don't know what to do 
with that: no lightweight SYNC or no SYNC at all - yes, it is still 
possible that SYNC on some systems can be too heavy or even harmful, 
nobody tested that.
