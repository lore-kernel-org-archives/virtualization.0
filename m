It's possible but we need at least pass the number of queues
through TUNSETIFF which may break the ABI? And this method
is not flexible as adding new ioctls, consider we may
disable some queues for some reaons such as running a single
queue guest or pxe on an multiple virtio-net backened.

If we use current driver without changes, it can run on host
that multiqueu enabled. But it can not make use all of the
queues.

Not yet, I would do it after I was back from KVM Forum.
