Sure, I'm not arguing for the current interface.

So, why not do this properly then?  ie. ida_get(ida, begin, end, gfp).

As for the end of range, shouldn't 0 mean the default max range?  Only
some users care about the upper limit anyway.  We can also make it
unsigned just in case and cap the value.

Thanks.
