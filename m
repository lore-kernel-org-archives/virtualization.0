Well that's not exactly true. I think we would like to make
it possible to put virtio devices behind an IOMMU on x86,
but if this means existing guests break, then many people won't be able
to use this option: having to find out which kernel version your guest
is running is a significant burden.


So on the host side, we need to detect guests that
don't program the IOMMU and make QEMU ignore it.
I think we need to figure out a way to do this
before we commit to the guest change.

Additionally, IOMMU overhead is very high when running within the VM.
So for uses such as VFIO, we'd like a way to make something like
iommu-pt the default.
