But I agree that allowing on-demand `struct page` allocation from the
device (rather than allocate using the guest memory) has lower risk,
maybe allowing this can be the first step to enable on-demand
allocation (actually it's not an overcommitting from the guest view
since the whole pmem memory range for struct page is reserved).
