I must be missing something here. As I look at the block driver (and
this is indicative of other drivers as well); the exit routine -
blkvsc_drv_exit, first iterates through all the devices it manages
and invokes device_unregister() on each of the devices and then 
invokes vmbus_child_driver_unregister() which is just a wrapper on
driver_unregister(). So, if I understand you correctly, you want the devices to
persist even if there is no driver bound to them. So, if I eliminated the code
that iterates over the devices and unregisters them, that should fix the problem
and I can do this without changing the vmbus core interfaces.
