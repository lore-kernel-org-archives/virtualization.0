PLE is unnecessary if you have "true" pv spinlocks where the 
next-in-line schedules itself out with a hypercall (Xen) or hlt 
instruction (KVM).  Set a bit in the qspinlock before going to sleep, 
and the lock owner will know that it needs to kick the next-in-line.

I think there is no need for the unfair lock bits.  1-2% is a pretty 
large hit.
