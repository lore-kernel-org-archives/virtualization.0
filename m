Perhaps I should have said instead "someone more familiar with PPC
than I am should figure out what PPC should do".  For the non-PPC
case, there is only one instance that I know of in which ignoring the
IOMMU is beneficial, and that case is the experimental Q35 thing.

If new kernels ignore the IOMMU for devices that don't set the flag
and there are physical devices that already exist and don't set the
flag, then those devices won't work reliably on most modern
non-virtual platforms, PPC included.

On x86, I think that even super-peformance-critical virtio devices
should always honor the iommu, but that the iommu in question should
be a 1:1 iommu.  I *think* that x86 supports that.  IOW x86 would
always set the feature flag.

As above, there's a difference between "bypass IOMMU" and "there is no
IOMMU".  x86 and, I think, most other platforms are capable of the
latter.  I'm not sure PPC is.

I think that, in an ideal world, there would be no feature flag and
all virtio devices would always respect the IOMMU.  Unfortunately we
have existing practice in the form of PPC and Q35 iommu=on that
conflict with that.

Would any non-PPC user ever configure it differently?  I suppose if
you want to support old kernels on new QEMU, you'd flip the switch.

I think we should flip the default everywhere to "respects IOMMU".
That's the setting that will work in all cases on new guest + new
host, and it's the setting that's safest.  vfio will probably always
malfunction if given a device that looks like it's behind an IOMMU but
doesn't respect it.  For people who need the last bit of performance,
they should use bus-level controls where available (they should be
available everywhere except PPC and maybe arm64) and, ideally, someone
would teach PPC how to exclude devices from the IOMMU cleanly if
possible.  If that can't be done, then there can be an option to
bypass the IOMMU the way it's currently done and no one except PPC
would do it.

PPC really is different from everything except x86 Q35 iommu=on, and
the latter is experimental.  AFAIK in all other cases, the IOMMU is
respected by virtio, but there is no non-1:1 IOMMU.
