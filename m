Dan,
I am sorry for not being as precise as I should be:
utf16s_to_utf8s() takes two length parameters - the length of the utf16 string
that is to be converted and the second the length of the utf8 output string.
The windows host manipulates all string in utf16 encoding and the string we get
from the host is guaranteed to be less than or equal to MAX value that we have
including the terminating character. In my code, I simply pass the length of the 
utf16 string as received from the host.

The parameter that I am currently passing MAX length value is the "maxout" 
parameter of the utf16s_utf8s() function. This by definition is the size of the
output buffer and in this case it happens to be MAX characters big.

As I described earlier, with the  host side guarantee that the string we get from
the host is always guaranteed to be less than or equal to MAX length
(including the terminating character), there is no question of going over the
size of the output buffer which is sized based on the host specification.
