Ok.

So, the race is basically on the memcpy?

Yes, config fields may be writeable both by the host and by the guest.

It is probably a bit cleaner concept wise, but I'm not wedded to it.

Another thing that comes to mind is that 'config generation' thing,
which is used on e.g. PCI to make sure that values longer than 32 bits
are consistent. I wonder whether we should explore that direction as
well.
