The wrappers suggestion sounds good.

One of the things we truly enjoyed about virtio is how easy it was to
reuse its drivers for communication with a remote processor.

It'd be great if we can stick to this design and keep vringh virtio
drivers decoupled from the low level implementation they are developed
with (specifically caif and remoteproc in this case).

It sounds like we can instead just avoid this altogether if we follow
Rusty's wrappers suggestion.

The result would probably look better, and I suspect it might be very
minimal code.

Unless I'm missing something here, adding wrappers should be straight
forward and quick. Coupling a virtio driver with remoteproc doesn't
look great to me, probably because I appreciate so much the elegance
of virtio and how easy we could have reused its vanilla drivers with a
use case it wasn't originally designed to support.

I was wondering - can you please explain your motivation for using
vringh in caif ?

We have internally discussed supporting multiple remote processors
talking to each other using rpmsg, and in that scenario using vringh
can considerably simplifies the solution (no need to decide in advance
which side is the "guest" and which is the "host"). Was this the
general incentive in using vringh in caif too or something else?

Thanks,
Ohad.
