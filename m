Agreed.

I consider it very unlikely that you want to provide something else than
- the old page
- a zeroed page

But yes, while having VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_REPORTING &&
!VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON in QEMU as of now would be possible, it's
unlikely that we'll see this very often. Similar to want_init_on_free()

I would encourage you to document the semantics of free page reporting
properly - especially, that we decided that the content of a reported
page with VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_REPORTING && !VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON is
*undefined* and needs a reinit. Only with VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_REPORTING &&
VIRTIO_BALLOON_F_PAGE_POISON the content is either the old page content
or a page filled with poison_val.
