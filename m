Thanks!

Okay so since LRO in virtio is actually running on top
of GRO/TSO in linux, looks like the only things worth preserving
that we don't preserve at the moment are the packet
boundaries, for which it's enough to report
the first segment size to guest - we have the total length,
from that we can calculate the last segment size.
