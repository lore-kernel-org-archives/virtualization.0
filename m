[PT] Why do you think it is unsupportable? How different is it from any module written against a well maintained interface? What overhead are you talking about?

[PT] This assumes that all the VF drivers would always be available. Also we have to support windows and our current design supports it nicely in an OS agnostic manner.

[PT] Having a full VF driver adds a lot of dependency on the guest VM and this is what NPA tries to avoid.

[PT] Today this is tied to vmxnet3 device and is intended to work on ESX hypervisor only (vmxnet3 works on VMware hypervisor only). All the loading support is inside the ESX hypervisor. I am going to post the interface between the shell and the plugin soon and you can see that there is not a whole lot of dependency or infrastructure requirements from the Linux kernel. Please keep in mind that we don't use Linux as a hypervisor but as a guest VM.
