I can definitely appreciate your concern here as the QEMU maintainer.

We most certainly have thought about long term userspace compatibility
with TCM.  Our userspace code (that's now available in all major
distros) is completely forward-compatible with new fabric modules such
as tcm_vhost.  No update required.

Also, by virtue of the fact that we are using configfs + rtslib (python
object library) on top, it's very easy to keep any type of compatibility
logic around in python code.  With rtslib, we are able to hide configfs
ABI changes from higher level apps.

So far we've had a track record of 100% userspace ABI compatibility in
mainline since .38, and I don't intend to merge a patch that breaks this
any time soon.  But if that ever happens, apps using rtslib are not
going to be effected.

As far as I am concerned, the kernel API (eg: configfs directory layout)
as it is now in sys/kernel/config/target/vhost/ is not going to change.
It's based on the same drivers/target/target_core_fabric_configfs.c
generic layout that we've had since .38.

The basic functional fabric layout in configfs is identical (with fabric
dependent WWPN naming of course) regardless of fabric driver, and by
virtue of being generic it means we can add things like fabric dependent
attributes + parameters in the future for existing fabrics without
breaking userspace.

So while I agree the ABI is more complex than vhost-blk, the logic in
target_core_fabric_configfs.c is a basic ABI fabric definition that we
are enforcing across all fabric modules in mainline for long term
compatibility.
