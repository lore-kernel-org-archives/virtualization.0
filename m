Yes.

There is the boring rmmod case that has always existed.

There is more interesting case of moving your tap device
into another network namespace.

In which case there is the possibility of the network namespace
exiting and destroying all of the virtual network devices before
we close the file handle.

I implemented the rtnetlink methods so we can test the uninit
behavior without going through all sorts of hoops.
