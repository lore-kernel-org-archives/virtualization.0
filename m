OK, seems like a straightforward xform: a few nit-picks:

Weird whitespace here.

I can't really see the justificaiton for a refill per queue.  Just have
one work iterate all the queues if it happens, unless it happens often
(in which case, we need to look harder at this anyway).

You leave napi here, and take it away in the next patch.  I think it's
supposed to go away now.

Cheers,
Rusty.
