The status is that I still think we need *a* way to actually inform the
guest whether the virtio implementation will or will not bypass the
IOMMU. I don't know Xen enough to figure out how to do that and we could
maybe just make it something qemu puts in the device-tree on powerpc
only.

However I dislike making it global or per-bus, we could have a
combination of qemu and HW virtio on the same guest, so I really think
this needs to be a capability of the virtio device.

I don't completely understand what games Xen is playing here, but from
what I can tell, it's pretty clear that today's qemu implementation
always bypasses any iommu and so should always be exported as such on
all platforms, at least all kvm and pure qemu ones.
