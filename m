Let's take a step back from the implementation details.
You are trying to add a new feature bit, after all.
Why? Why is silent deflate useful? This is what is
missing in all this discussion. If it is not useful
we do not need a bit for it.

Sorry this is not the example I asked for.  Please give and example
without migration.

Migration is qemu's problem: it is hypervisor's job to
make sure guest sees no change during migration.
It should be able to do this with any hardware it emulates,
there should be no need to change hardware to make it
"migrateable" somehow.
