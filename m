Registering the id at creation and blocking in gem export is feasible,
but it doesn't work well for systems with a centralized buffer
allocator that doesn't support batch allocations (e.g. gralloc). In
such a system, the round trip latency would almost certainly be
included in the buffer allocation time. At least on the system I'm
working on, I suspect that would add 10s of milliseconds of startup
latency to video pipelines (although I haven't benchmarked the
difference). Doing the blocking as late as possible means most or all
of the latency can be hidden behind other pipeline setup work.

In terms of complexity, I think the synchronization would be basically
the same in either approach, just in different locations. All it would
do is alleviate the need for a callback to fetch the UUID.
