I think all this complexity makes no sense to me.

Who cares of sysfs reading a value that might be updated ?
This is purely a debugging utility.

As soon as you read the value, it might already have changed anyway.

Its a integer, just read it without special care.

atomic_read() has also same 'problem', and we do not care.

Make sure that a recompute (aka ewma_add()) does not store intermediate
wrong values, by using ACCESS_ONCE(), and thats enough. No need for the
seqcount overhead.
