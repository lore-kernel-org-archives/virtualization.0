My gut reaction would be to avoid using clocksources for now. While
there is some thought going into how to expand clocksources for other
uses (Daniel is working on this, for example), the design for
clocksources has been very focused on its utility to timekeeping, so I'm
hesitant to try complicate the clocksources in order to multiplex
functionality until what is really needed is well understood.

I suspect the best approach would be see how the sched_clock interface
can be reworked/used for what you want, as it's design goals map closest
to the work-unit properties you list above.

Then we can look to see how clocksources can be best used to implement
the sched_clock interface.
