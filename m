I wanted to kill the whole sentence, but killed only a part of
it. :( Sorry. If any, the sentence had only significance for judging how
well inherited some names fit.

It is all in the code :). To have complete and definitive answers here
we would need some sort of public UV architecture.

I'm not sure how much can we do on the doc front. Without a complete
architecture, one basically needs to trust the guys with access to the
architecture.

Many thanks for your feedback. Regards,
