Hi Amit,

Thank you for commenting on our work.

Thanks. We will improve this patch set.

No, this patch set is used only for guest kernels, so guest and host
don't need to run the same kernel.

To minimize effects for applications on guests when a host collects
tracing data of guests.
For example, we assume the situation where guests A and B are running
on a host sharing I/O device. An I/O delay problem occur in guest A,
but it doesn't for the requirement in guest B. In this case, we need to
collect tracing data of guests A and B, but a usual method using
network takes high load for applications of guest B even if guest B is
normally running. Therefore, we try to decrease the load on guests.
We also use this feature for performance analysis on production
virtualization systems.

Thanks! In this case, since a guest will stop to run when host reads
trace data of the guest, char device is needed to add a non-blocking
mode. I'll read your patch series. Is the latest version 8?

a) To make collecting overhead decrease for application on a guest.
    (see above)
b) Trace data of host kernel is not involved even if we introduce this
    patch set.
