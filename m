Hi Simon !

"pacing" is done because skb is attached to a socket, and a socket has =
a
limited (but configurable) sndbuf. sk->sk_wmem_alloc is the current sum
of all truesize skbs in flight.

When you enter something that :

1) Get a clone of the skb, queue the clone to device X
2) queue the original skb to device Y

Then :	Socket sndbuf is not affected at all by device X queue.
	This is speed on device Y that matters.

You want to get servo control on both X and Y

You could try to

1) Get a clone of skb
   Attach it to socket too (so that socket get a feedback of final
orphaning for the clone) with skb_set_owner_w()
   queue the clone to device X

Unfortunatly, stacked skb->destructor() makes this possible only for
known destructor (aka sock_wfree())
