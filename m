True.  You can use all of the call clobbered registers.

I guess if the code is larger than a function call I'm failing to see
the disadvantage in making it a direct function call.  Any modern
processor ought to be able to predict it perfectly, and processors
like the P4 may even optimize the call out of their L1 instruction
cache.

If what David is suggesting works, making all of these direct calls
looks easy and very maintainable.   At which point patching
instructions inline is quite possibly overkill.

Is it truly critical to inline any of these instructions?
