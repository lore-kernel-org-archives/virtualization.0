Supporting PCI PRI is a separate problem, that will be implemented by
extending the event queue proposed in v0.5. Once the guest bound the PASID
table and created the page tables, it will start some DMA job in the
device. If a page isn't mapped, the pIOMMU sends a PRI Request (a page
fault) to its driver, which is relayed to userspace by VFIO, then to the
guest via virtio-iommu. The guest handles the fault, then sends a PRI
response on the virtio-iommu request queue, relayed to the pIOMMU driver
via VFIO and the device retries the access.

PASID table is what we call Context Table in SMMU, it's the array
associating a PASID (SSID) to a context descriptor. In the SMMUv3 the
stream table entry (device descriptor) points to a PASID table. Each
context descriptor in the PASID table points to a page directory (pgd).

So the first solution was for the guest to send a BIND with pasid+pgd, and
let the host deal with the context tables. The second solution is to send
a BIND with a PASID table pointer, and have the guest handle the context
table.

Yes for non-SVM in SMMuv3, you still have a context table but with a
single descriptor, so the interface stays the same. But with the second
solution, nested with SMMUv2 isn't supported since it doesn't have context
tables. The second solution was considered simpler to implement, so we'll
first go with this one.
