        Yes, but I probably broke it in the transfer -- will be more
careful with the next revision.

        It needs the heads and the lengths, which looks a lot
like an iovec. I was trying to resist adding a new
struct XXX { unsigned head; unsigned len; } just for this,
but I could make these parallel arrays, one with head index and
the other with length.

        I can move it to vhost_get_heads(), sure.

        From our prior discussion, what I had in mind was that
we'd remove all special-header processing by using the ioctl
you added for TUN and later, an equivalent ioctl for raw (when
supported in qemu-kvm). Qemu would arrange headers with tap
(and later raw) to get what the guest expects, and vhost then
just passes all data as-is between the socket and the ring.
        That not only removes the different-header-len code
for mergeable buffers, but also eliminates making a copy of the
header for every packet as before. Vhost has no need to do
anything with the header, or even know its length. It also
doesn't have to care what the type of the backend is-- raw or
tap.
        I think that simplifies everything, but it does mean that
raw socket support requires a header ioctl for the different
vnethdr sizes if the guest wants a vnethdr with and without
mergeable buffers. Actually, I thought this was your idea and
the point of the TUNSETVNETHDRSZ ioctl, but I guess you had
something else in mind?

        EAGAIN is not possible after the change, because we don't
even enter the loop unless we have an skb on the read queue; the
other cases bomb out, so I figured the comment for future work is
now done. :-)

        I wanted to avoid the header copy here, with the reasonable 
restriction
that the guest gives you a buffer at least big enough for the vnet_hdr. A
length check alone (on iov[0].iov_len) could enforce that without copying
headers back and forth to support silly cases like 8-byte buffers or
num_buffers spanning multiple iovecs, and I think paying the price of the
copy on every packet to support guests that broken isn't worth it.
        So, my preference here would be to add:

        if (vhost_has_feature(&net->dev, VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF))
                struct virtio_net_mrg_rxbuf *vhdr...

                if (vq->iov[0].iov_len < sizeof(*vhdr)) {
                        vq_err(vq, "tiny buffers (len %d < %d) are not 
supported",
                                vq->iov[0].iov_len, sizeof(*vhdr));
                        break;
                }
                /* add num_bufs */
                ...

Does that work for you?

I don't have any to test with w/ current qemu-kvm, but again, I thought
your plan was to remove special header processing from vhost and let
the socket end do it via ioctl. Wouldn't a similar ioctl for raw
sockets when supported by qemu do that?

        Right. With the ioctl, and assuming raw gets a similar
one, we don't need to know anything about the header size in
vhost, except that qemu needs to make sure mergeable rxbufs is
only set when the socket has the larger vnet_hdr that includes
the num_bufs field.

        26 chars for the function name with indentation and
argument list might not be pretty on the calls. What about
changing vhost_get_desc() and vhost_get_desc_n() [make them
both shorter]? ("_n" indicating >= 1 instead of just one).

        I'd actually prefer to go the other way, and remove the
log stuff, for example, since they are accessible from vq which
we have already. Adding heads make it look less similar to the
arg list for vhost_get_vq_desc(), but I'm more interested in
getting the feature than particular arg lists, so your call.

It is calling vhost_get_vq_desc() in this loop; that's how it
gets the indiviual heads and iov entries. The rest of it is just
massaging the offsets so vhost_get_vq_desc puts them all in the
right places and tracks the heads and lengths correctly for add_used.

I generally would rather see the error cleanup explicitly where the
error detection and message are, for code readability, but I can change
it to a goto here if you think that's clearer.

        This is to remove a compiler warning that "used" may
be used unitialized, for a case that can't happen (count <= 0).

        The indexes are free-running counters, so if
avail_idx has overflowed but last_avail_idx has not
then the result will be (incorrectly) negative. It
has nothing to do with how many buffers are in use--
consider avail_idx = 2 and last_avail_idx = 65534,
then avail = will be -65532, but we want it to be 4.

        Mainly what I was after here is to not affect signal's
for the transmit side. I thought about splitting it into a
separate function entirely for the transmit, but came up with
this, instead. I can't tell if it's a receiver from the vq,
but I don't want to override NOTIFY_ON_EMPTY or the headcount
check (which has nothing to do with transmitters) for the
transmitter at all.
        The vq doesn't tell you if it is a receiver or not,
so I either need a flag as argument to tell, or I need to
split into a transmit vhost_signal and a receive vhost_signal.
        I can do the available check before calling vhost_signal,
but then I need to remove the NOTIFY check entirely so it'll
still notify for the receiver case when available is not
enough but still not 0.
        So, I think the options are:
1) a flag
2) separate transmit or receive signal functions
3) move NOTIFY_ON_EMPTY out of vhost_signal and
        check that or available (for recvr) before
        calling vhost_signal().

        It definitely hurts performance to allocate max-sized buffers
and then free up the excess (the translate_desc is expensive). It is
a heuristic, but it's one that keeps the notifies flowing without
having to fail on a packet to reenable them.
        The notify code has to change because there is no recovery
if we need 5 buffers and have only 3, while notification is
disabled unless we go all the way to 0. We can't honor NOTIFY_ON_EMPTY
in that case because it will never proceed. We can remove the
NOTIFY_ON_EMPTY check in vhost_signal and do it in the caller; then allow
receiver to fail a buffer allocation and signal unconditionally,
but we cannot wait for it to be 0 even if NOTIFY_ON_EMPTY is set--
that's a deadlock.

        I tried requiring at least 64K here always, but as
I said before, the cost of doing the translate_desc and
then throwing those away for small packets killed performance.
I also considered using a highwater mark on the ring, but
potentially differing buffer sizes makes that less useful,
and a small ring may only have enough space for 1 max-sized
packet. 
        Maybe we should just remove NOTIFY_ON_EMPTY if we
fail a packet allocation; I can try that out.
        Another alternative I considered was splitting out
the translate_desc stuff in the hopes that we could found
out how many buffers we need in a less-expensive way; then
we could go for max-sized and free the excess without too
much overhead, maybe.
        Anyway, I'll look harder at working around this.

        That's actually an artifact from the previous patch. I
was arranging the iovec to have just the header needed by the
guest and this simplified the bounds checking. It can be
removed if we leave header size management to the socket side,
but if vhost is going to be doing vnet_hdr manipulation for
raw sockets, then it'll depend on what that new code needs
to do to manage the header, I suppose.
