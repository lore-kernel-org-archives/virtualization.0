When nothing new were queued during vhost thread is running. This change
may add two more spin-locks which may not but optimal. But if several
packets were queued by tun during vhost thread is running, it may save
lots of unnecessary wake ups. So the patch helps the performance in the
heavy load case for sure. In light load case, it may hurt some
throughput but cpu and thru/cpu is still saved.
