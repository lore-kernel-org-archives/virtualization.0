Well this is not that easy. It requires a cooperation from maintainers.
I can only do as much. I've posted patches in the past and actively
bringing up this topic at LSFMM last two years...

I didn't NACK the patch AFAIR. I've said it is not a good idea longterm.
I would be much more willing to change my mind if you would back your
patch by a real bug report. Hacks are acceptable when we have a real
issue in hands. But if we want to fix potential issue then better make
it properly.

Agreed!
