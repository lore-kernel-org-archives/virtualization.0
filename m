- holes hitting the kernel image is not something we can do anything about.

- I have always believed we need to export enough information so the
  bootloader can verify that we don't hit a hole in the initial
  kernel image.

- I know of one system that had BIOS tables at 16MB I believe (and
  thus had a fairly low hole).

- Given that we are actually increasing (not decreasing) the number of
  scenarios where we boot the kernel it probably makes sense to be
  as robust as we can.

- If we support putting the ramdisk immediately after the kernel image
  in memory we will actually hit this case in practice.

Agreed.  However that is essentially all statically allocated memory
and the best we can do at this point in time.
