Oh that's because that's what the existing code did, so
the original version of the patch left the bug in place.
I wanted to include the fix and I wrote this in the
commit message, but I forgot to include it in the code :(

Thankfully this just means that the commit log is wrong,
the code is just unchanged from 4.4, and I'll
include a fix in my tree shortly.
