Hi. This patchset implements ia64/pv_ops support which is the
framework for virtualization support.
Please review and comments.

On x86 various ways to support virtualization were proposed, and
eventually pv_ops won. So on ia64 the pv_ops strategy is appropriate too.
Later I'll post the patchset which implements xen domU based on
ia64/pv_ops. Currently only ia64/xen pv_ops implementation exists,
but I believe ia64/kvm can also obtain benefits from this ia64/pv_ops
frame work.

Eddie Dong also has been working on ia64/pv_ops and posted a mail
requesting for suggestion/comments.
The corresponding patch is "[10/15] ia64/pv_ops: paravirtualize entry.S"
As discussed before, ivt.S was paravirtualized by single source and multi
compile way. But he thinks other way is appropriate for other hand
written assembly code. Which way is acceptable?


This patchset does the followings.
- some preparation work. Mainly make the kernel virtualization friendly.
- introduce pv_info which describes the execution environment.
- introduce macros for hand written assembly code to paravirtualize
  hand written code to replace sensitive/privileged instructions.
- introduce various hooks to replace the implementation with
  paravirtualized.
  They are defined as function tables called, pv_init_ops, pv_cpu_ops,
  pv_irq_ops, pv_iosapic_ops and, pv_time_ops.
  They represent
    pv_init_ops: hooks for various initialization.
    pv_cpu_ops: hooks for ia64 intrinsics.
    pv_irq_ops: hooks for irq related operations.
    pv_iosapic_ops: hooks for paravirtualized iosapic.
    pv_time_ops: hooks for steal time accounting


The working full source is available from
http://people.valinux.co.jp/~yamahata/xen-ia64/linux-2.6-xen-ia64.git/
branch: xen-ia64-2008apr08

At this phase, we don't address the following issues.
Those will be addressed after the first merge.
- optimization by binary patch
  In fact, we had the patch to do that, but we intentionally dropped
  for patch size/readability/cleanness.
- freeing the unused pages, i.e. pages for unused ivt.S.

Changes from take 3:
- split the patch set into pv_op part and xen domU part.
- many clean ups.
- introduced pv_ops: pv_cpu_ops and pv_time_ops.

Changes from take 2:
- many clean ups following to comments.
- clean up:assembly instruction macro.
- introduced pv_ops: pv_info, pv_init_ops, pv_iosapic_ops, pv_irq_ops.

Changes from take 1:
Single IVT source code. compile multitimes using assembler macros.

thanks,
