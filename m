If you have to respin, consider improving the grammar:

virtio_scsi_target_state is now empty.  We will find new uses for it in
the next few patches, so this patch does not drop it completely.
However, having dropped the sglist flexible array member, we can turn
the tgt array-of-pointers into a simple array.  This simplifies the
allocation.

Even simpler would be to place the virtio_scsi_target_state structs in a
flexible array member at the end of struct virtio_scsi.  But we do not
do that, because we will place the virtqueues there in the next patches.
