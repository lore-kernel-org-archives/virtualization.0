smp_read_barrier_depends() has gone the way of mmiowb() and so many
esoteric memory barriers before it. Drop the two mentions of this
deceased barrier from the LKMM informal explanation document.

 In practice, this difficulty is solved by inserting a special fence

 The LKMM requires that smp_rmb(), acquire fences, and strong fences

 And of course, none of this matters for any architecture other than
 Alpha.
