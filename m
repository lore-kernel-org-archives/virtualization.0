Well, one could come up with a mechanism to bind an interface to be only 
visible to a particular context/container/something.

Well, if you can just tag everything based on interface its relatively 
simple.

Well, a stream-like protocol layered over a reliable packet transport 
would get you there without the complexity of tcp.  Or just do a 
usermode tcp; its not that complex if you really think it simplifies the 
other aspects.

Well, off the top of my head I'm assuming the requirements are:

    * the goal is to unify the user's actual desktop session with a
      virtual session within a vm
    * a given user may have multiple VMs running on their desktop
    * a VM may be serving multiple user sessions
    * the VMs are not necessarily hosted by the user's desktop machine
    * the VMs can migrate at any moment

To me that looks like a daemon running within the context of each of the 
user's virtual sessions monitoring clipboard events, talking over a TCP 
connection to a corresponding daemon in their desktop session, which is 
responsible for reconciling cuts and pastes in all the various sessions.

I guess you'd say that each VM would multiplex all its cut/paste events 
via its AF_VMCHANNEL/cut+paste channel to its qemu, which would then 
demultiplex them off to the user's real desktops.  And that since the VM 
itself may have no networking, it needs to be a special magic connection.

And my counter argument to this nicely placed straw man is that the 
VM<->qemu connection can still be TCP, even if its a private network 
with no outside access.

You mean 9p directly over a virtio ringbuffer rather than via the 
network stack?  You could do that, but I'd still argue that using the 
network stack is a better approach.

There's no need to put the "filesystem" into the kernel unless something 
else in the kernel needs to access it.  A usermode implementation 
talking over some stream interface would be fine.

Or just use a tcp connection, and do it all with no kernel mods.

(Is 9p a good choice?  You need to be able to subscribe to events 
happening to files, and you'd need some kind of atomicity guarantee.  I 
dunno, maybe 9p already has this or can be cleanly adapted.)
