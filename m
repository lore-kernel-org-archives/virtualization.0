I've stopped at this patch (well, I applied one more, but you can see
that.)

I'd like to get some confirmation that this is really what you all want
to do here before applying it.  If it is, care to resend them with a bit
more information about this issue and why you all are making it?

Anyway, other than this one, the series looks good.  But you should
follow-up with some driver structure changes like what Christoph said to
do.  After that, do you want another round of review of the code, or do
you have more things you want to send in (like the name[64] removal?)

thanks,
