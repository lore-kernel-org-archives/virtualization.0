TSC is a real dependency of the Xen interfaces.

True.

X86_TSC not being enabled appears to due to CONFIG_ELAN being enabled
which causes the processor selection option (which defaults to M686,
which is a sane choice and enables TSC etc) to be gated at the top level
in arch/x86/Kconfig.cpu. Disabling the ELAN option then leaves X86_TSC
gated on !CONFIG_NUMAQ but removing that results in a generally useful
looking config.

It's a shame that these sorts of minority options cause allmodconfig to
omit support for more interesting configurations, such as modern
processors. Other than negating the semantics of such options I'm not
really sure what can be done about it though. On the other hand
compiling all the unusual stuff in an allmodconfig is probably a
positive thing.

I'm not sure why ELAN belongs in the EXTENDED_PLATFORM option space
rather than in the CPU choice option, since its only impact seems to be
on -march, MODULE_PROC_FAMILY and some cpufreq drivers which doesn't
sound like an extended platform to me but does it appear to be
deliberate (see 9e111f3e167a "x86: move ELAN to the
NON_STANDARD_PLATFORM section", that was the old name for
EXTENDED_PLATFORM).

Hrm, what about the following? (doesn't actually make a difference to
Xen since allmodconfig chooses HIGHMEM4G instead of HIGHMEM64G in the !
NUMAQ case but I stopped worrying about that several paragraphs ago)

8<--------

x86: invert X86_EXTENDED_PLATFORM to X86_STANDARD_PLATFORM

Having the =y choice be the more "standard" configuration causes
all*config to provide greater coverage of usual configurations.
