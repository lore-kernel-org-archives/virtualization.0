Let us start with what is broken currently. Looking at
it very closely, I think the answer is nothing.
Even migration in qemu is not broken as you claimed initially.

Next, consider the interface proposed here. You defacto declare
all existing drivers buggy. This is a wrong thing to do.
You also use two feature bits for a single simple thing,
this is inelegant.

Last, let us consider how existing feature can be used
in the hypervisor. If driver did not ack
MUST_TELL_HOST, it is *not* buggy but it means we can not
do munlock. This applies to current windows drivers.
If driver *did* ack MUST_TELL_HOST, we can munlock
and mlock back on leak.
Seems useful, driver support is already there,
so removing the MUST_TELL_HOST bit seems like a bad idea.
