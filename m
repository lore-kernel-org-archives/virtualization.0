Hmm, the version that I sent you awhile ago (remember I sent you an attachment 
with prototype of the new tun driver and user space code) was not that bad in 
that area. It mean it did not touch existing read()/write() path. The 
difference was that it allocated the rings and the data buffer in the kernel 
and mapped into the user-space. Which is not what you guys need but that's a 
separate thing.

The fd thing could be an issue. As I mentioned the example would be a VPN 
server (OpenVPN, etc) with a bunch of client connection (typically tun per 
connection).

I see.

I'll try to spend some time on this in a near future and take a crack at the 
version with the TUN specific rings. Although I said that many times now and 
it may not happen in the near enough future :). In the mean time if your 
current version helps you guys a lot I do not mind us putting it in. We can 
always add another mode or something that uses internal rings and gradually 
obsolete old read()/write() and generic rings.
