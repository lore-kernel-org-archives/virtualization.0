I started modifying tun to do this directly, but it ended up with a whole heap 
of code just for the rings, and a lot of current code (eg. read, write, poll) 
ended up inside an 'if (tun->rings) ... else {'.  Having a natural poll() 
interface for the rings made more sense, so being their own fds fell out 
naturally.

I decided to float this version because it does minimal damage to tun, and I 
know that other people have wanted rings before: I'd like to know if this is 
likely to be generic enough for them.

Thanks!
Rusty
