Right; so I've gone back to a simple version (~200 lines) that's fairly
easy to comprehend (to me, since I wrote it). And will now try to see if
I can find the same state transitions in your code.

I find your code somewhat hard to follow; mostly due to those xchg() +
fixup thingies. But I'll get there.

Yeah, I get why you need a whole byte for the lock part, I was asking if
we really need another whole byte for the pending part.

So in my version I think I see an optimization case where this is indeed
useful and I can trade an atomic op for a write barrier, which should be
a big win.

It just wasn't at all clear (to me) from your code.

(I also think the optimization isn't x86 specific)

I've got a version that does the pending thing and still is entirely
fair.

I don't think the concept of the extra spinner is incompatible with
fairness.

Thanks, I'll have a play.
