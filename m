OK, that's different, we should not be triggering a warning for that.
What does your machine/virtblk topology look like in terms of CPUS,
nr of queues for virtblk, etc?

You can probably get this info the easiest by just doing a:

# find /sys/kernel/debug/block/virtX

replace virtX with your virtblk device name. Generate this info both
before and after the hotplug event.

It's not supposed to happen for your case, so I'd say it's been useful.
It's not a critical thing, but it is something that should not trigger
and we need to look into why it did, and fixing it up.
