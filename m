Hey Greg,

Can you tell me how this could work out -- each console port could have
a "role" string associated with it (obtainable from the invoking qemu
process in case of qemu/kvm). Something that I have in mind currently
is:

$ qemu-kvm ... -virtioconsole role=org/qemu/clipboard

and then the guest kernel sees the string, and puts the
"org/qemu/clipboard" in some file in sysfs. Guest userspace should then
be able to open and read/write to

/dev/virtio_console/org/qemu/clipboard

I guess that's an acceptable scheme to all.

I also don't know how this would work -- which sysfs attributes to
export and how would udev pick that up and create the device at the
specified location.

Any pointers appreciated.

Thanks,
		Amit
