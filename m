I agree with you. It is already doing that. But my approach here is
little different.

In 2 classes of vcpus we have (one is subset of another when we try to
do yield_to) viz,

1) runnable and kicked < (subset of) 2) just runnable

what we are trying to do here is targeting 1) first so that we get good
lock progress.

Here was the sequence I was talking.

vcpu1 releases lock->finds that vcpu2  is next candidate ->
kick hypercall -> kvm_pv_kick_cpu_op -> set kicked flag ->
vcpu->kick(vcpu2)

at this point we have vcpu2 waiting for getting scheduled. But
above yield call can wake *anybody*.

I agree this is not serious (rather it is overhead) when there are are 
less number of vcpus, But when we have more number of vcpu/vm.. it may
not scale well. My attempt was to fix that.

Let me know if I am completely missing something..

Ok ... But we also should be cautious that, we may do more halt, though 
we are about to get spinlock.
Need more study on this.
