Hi David,

Do you mean the VMCI calls?  The VMCI driver is in the process of being
upstreamed into the drivers/misc tree.  Greg (cc'd on these patches) is
actively reviewing that code and we are addressing feedback.

Also, there was some interest from RedHat into using vSockets as a unified
interface, routed over a hypervisor-specific transport (virtio or
otherwise, although for now VMCI is the only one implemented).

Thanks!
- Andy
