The virtqueue implementation I envision will be almost identical to the
current virtio_ring virtqueue implementation, with the following
exceptions:

* the "shared memory" will actually be remote, on the PCI BAR of a device
* iowrite32(), ioread32() and friends will be needed to access the memory
* there will only be a fixed number of virtqueues available, due to PCI
  BAR size
* cross-endian virtqueues must work
* kick needs to be cross-machine (using PCI IRQ's)

I don't think it is feasible to add this to the existing implementation.
I think the requirement of being cross-endian will be the hardest to
overcome. Rusty did not envision the cross-endian use case when he
designed this, and it shows, in virtio_ring, virtio_net and vhost. I
have no idea what to do about this. Do you have any ideas?


I plan to create a custom socket similar to tun/macvtap which will use
DMA to transfer around data. This, along with a few other tricks, will
allow me to use vhost_net to operate the device. Along with a custom
virtqueue implementation meeting the requirements above, this seems like
a good plan.

Thanks for responding,
Ira
