I haven't checked emails for days and did not realize the new revision
had already came out. And thank you for the effort, this revision
really looks to be a step forward towards our use case and is close to
what we wanted to do. A few questions in line.

Could it made it also possible to take over the config from VF instead
of virtio on an existing VM image? And get udev rename the bypass
netdev to what the original VF was. I don't say tightly binding the
bypass master to only virtio or VF, but I think we should provide both
options to support different upgrade paths. Possibly we could tweak
the device tree layout to reuse the same PCI slot for the master
bypass netdev, such that udev would not get confused when renaming the
device. The VF needs to use a different function slot afterwards.
Perhaps we might need to a special multiseat like QEMU device for that
purpose?

Our case we'll upgrade the config from VF to virtio-bypass directly.

Is it this uglier in terms of user experience rather than
functionality? I don't want it dynamically changed between 2-netdev
and 3-netdev depending on the presence of VF. That gets back to my
original question and suggestion earlier: why not just hide the lower
netdevs from udev renaming and such? Which important observability
benefits users may get if exposing the lower netdevs?

Thanks,
