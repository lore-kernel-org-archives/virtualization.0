You have the same problem when real PCIe devices appear that speak
virtio. I think the only real (still not very nice) solution is to add a
quirk to powerpc platform code that sets noop dma-ops for the existing
virtio vendor/device-ids and add a DT property to opt-out of that quirk.

New vendor/device-ids (as for real devices) would just not be covered by
the quirk and existing emulated devices continue to work.

The absence of the property just means that the quirk is in place and
the system assumes no translation for virtio devices.
