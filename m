Apropos the UDP flow control.  See this
http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg150806.html
for some problems it introduces.
Unfortunately UDP does not have built-in flow control.
At some level it's just conceptually broken:
it's not present in physical networks so why should
we try and emulate it in a virtual network?


Specifically, when you do:
# netperf -c -4 -t UDP_STREAM -H 172.17.60.218 -l 30 -- -m 1472
You are asking: what happens if I push data faster than it can be received?
But why is this an interesting question?
Ask 'what is the maximum rate at which I can send data with %X packet
loss' or 'what is the packet loss at rate Y Gb/s'. netperf has
-b and -w flags for this. It needs to be configured
with --enable-intervals=yes for them to work.

If you pose the questions this way the problem of pacing
the execution just goes away.

What if you have multiple UDP sockets with different targets
in the guest?
