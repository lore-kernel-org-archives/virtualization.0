Shouldn't this diffstat be something like the following?

 drivers/scsi/Kconfig                       |    7 +
 drivers/scsi/Makefile                      |    3 +
 drivers/{staging/hv =3D> scsi}/storvsc_drv.c |  310 ++++++++++++++++++=

 3 files changed, 218 insertions(+), 102 deletions(-)
 rename drivers/{staging/hv =3D> scsi}/storvsc_drv.c (87%)
