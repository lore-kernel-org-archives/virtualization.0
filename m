Ok, but then you should use a lock to protect the variable, not an atomic_t.

If you care about this, because some other thread is looking at it, then
you really need to protect it with a lock.  Don't rely on a mb() to get
it all correct for you (hint, I doubt it will...)

Looks like a bug in checkpatch.pl, go poke Andy about that please.

Yes, I know what it stands for, but the rest of the world doesn't :)
