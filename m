Thanks for confirming the results!
The best way to use this patch would be along with a shared vhost thread 
for multiple
devices/vms, as described in:
http://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/1e4115aea78b6e7c85256b360066f0d4/479e3578ed05bfac85257b4200427735!OpenDocument
This work assumes having a dedicated I/O core where the vhost thread 
serves multiple vms, which 
makes the high cpu utilization less of a concern.

Good point, will reduce it and recheck.
Thank you,
