Well, the way it should work is that each virtio-blk device should have
its own set of *virtual* keyslots on the host side.  From the guest's
perspective it would act very similarly to UFS / eMMC inline encryption,
and it would be easy to integrate into the existing stack.

Then to process encrypted I/O, the host would use the keyslot number in
the I/O to look up the blk_crypto_key it previously saved, and issue I/O
using that key (using bio_crypt_set_ctx()).  The existing keyslot
management logic in the block layer would allocate or wait for a
physical keyslot as needed, so it should just work.

Eviction would similarly be passed through to blk_crypto_evict_key().

Note that with this design, there would be no static partitioning of the
physical keyslots.  The host would just allocate and release them as
needed, similar to memory allocation.  The total number of virtual
keyslots could be greater than the number of physical keyslots.

This design would also work with hardware-wrapped keys.

The hardest part is still the UAPIs for the VMM to do what it needs to
do (assuming that it even needs to support physical inline encryption
hardware at all, and not simply use the AES acceleration on the CPU),
but that is the case with any of the proposals.
