virtio is implemented in qemu though. If you prefer to stick
all your code in either guest or the UV that's your decision
but it looks like qemu could be helpful here.

For example what if you have a guest that passes physical addresses
to qemu bypassing swiotlb? Don't you want to detect
that and fail gracefully rather than crash the guest?
That's what VIRTIO_F_IOMMU_PLATFORM will do for you.

Still that's hypervisor's decision. What isn't up to the hypervisor is
the way we structure code. We made an early decision to merge a hack
with xen, among discussion about how with time DMA API will learn to
support per-device quirks and we'll be able to switch to that.
So let's do that now?

That each platform wants to add hacks in this data path function.
