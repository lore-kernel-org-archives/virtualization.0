Yeah, that has been my guess as well, however I am not privy to the
inner workings of Xen, so was not sure.

xen_register_gsi and hence, xen_register_pirq are called from
init (with xen_setup_acpi_sci) and non-init (with
acpi_register_gsi_xen); since xen_set_acpi_sci calls it with gsi ==
acpi_sci_override_gsi and is marked __init, the best way would be to
call xen_register_gsi and xen_register_pirq with a boolean argument like
sci_override to obviate the need to use acpi_sci_override_gsi in
register_pirq. I will send the patch with this change if it looks good.
