Right. This was suggested in "Fwd: Virtio-1.1 Ring Layout".
Or just the PI if we don't need the queue number.

This seems similar to the design we currently have with a separate used
ring. It seems to underperform writing into the available ring
at least on a microbenchmark. The reason seems to be that
more cache lines need to get invalidated and re-fetched.

> CQEs are continuous in memory so prefetching by the driver is efficient, although the device might complete work descriptors out of order.

That's not different from proposal you are replying to - descriptors
can be used and written out in any order, they are contigious
so driver can prefetch. I'd like to add that attempts to
add prefetch e.g. for the virtio used ring never showed any
conclusive gains - some workloads would get minor a speedup, others
lose a bit of performance. I do not think anyone looked
deeply into why that was the case. It would be easy for you to add this
code to current virtio drivers and/or devices and try it out.

> The interrupt handler is connected to the CQ, so an allocation of a single CQ per core, with a single interrupt handler is possible although this core might be using multiple WQs.

Sending a single interrupt from multiple rings might save some
cycles. event index/interrupt disable are currently in
RAM so access is very cheap for the guest.
If you are going to share, just disable all interrupts
when you start processing.

I was wondering how do people want to do this in hardware
in fact. Are you going to read event index after each descriptor?

It might make sense to move event index/flags into device memory. And
once you do this, writing these out might become slower, and then some
kind of sharing of the event index might help.

No one suggested anything like this so far - maybe it's less of an issue
than I think, e.g. because of interrupt coalescing (which virtio also
does not have, but could be added if there is interest) or maybe people
just mostly care about polling performance.

A ring per QOS level might make sense e.g. in a network device. I don't
see why it's helpful to write out completed entries into a separate
ring for that though.

As we don't have QOS support in virtio net at all right now,
would that be best discussed once we have a working prototype
and everyone can see what the problem is?
