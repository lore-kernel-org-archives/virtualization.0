Well... you have your "host" computer, and than (potentially several)
Intel MIC devices, which are basically separate computers. So X100 is
not a multicomputer, but machine with several X100 cards certainly is
multicomputer.

Coprocessor sounds like i487, but why not.

Agreed it is long. drivers/coproc? 

[I guess we'll get similar hardware from different vendors in
future. It would make sense having it at common place.]
