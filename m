Config knobs suck too; they create a maintenance burden (we get to make
sure all the permutations works/build/etc..) and effectively nobody uses
them, since world+dog uses what distros pick.

Anyway, instead of adding a second per-cpu variable, can you see how
horrible something like this is:

unsigned char adds(unsigned char var, unsigned char val)
{
	unsigned short sat = 0xff, tmp = var;

	asm ("addb	%[val], %b[var];"
	     "cmovc	%[sat], %[var];"
	     : [var] "+r" (tmp)
	     : [val] "ir" (val), [sat] "r" (sat)
	     );

	return tmp;
}

Another thing to try is, instead of threading that lockval throughout
the thing, simply:

#define _Q_LOCKED_VAL	this_cpu_read_stable(cpu_sat)

or combined with the above

#define _Q_LOCKED_VAL	adds(this_cpu_read_stable(cpu_number), 2)

and see if the compiler really makes a mess of things.
