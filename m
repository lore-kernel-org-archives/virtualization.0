Why is this so non-trivial ? All you have to do is _NOT_ register
PIT/HPET/APIC timers and register a per CPU hyper-CE-device instead,
which uses the hypervisor timer emulation instead of real hardware.

clockevents breaks the hardwired assumptions of the old timer code and
allows you to remove _ALL_ the hardwired hackery in vmitimer.c, i.e.
stuff like

       /* Disable PIT. */
        outb_p(0x3a, PIT_MODE); /* binary, mode 5, LSB/MSB, ch 0 */

This is ugly as hell. NO_HZ enables the dyntick functions in idle(),
irq_enter() and irq_exit() so the clockevents code is actually invoked.
I have not looked close enough why this does work at all.

I have the feeling that "working fine" means something like "does not
explode".

We really want to fix this now instead of pushing some not know why it
works hack into the kernel.
