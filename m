If we don't load the blkvsc driver, the emulated IDE controller exposed to
the guest can and will be seen by the libata core. In this case though, your
disk I/O will be taking the emulated path with the usual performance hit.

When you load the blkvsc driver, the device access does not go through the emulated
IDE controller. Blkvsc is truly a generic block driver that registers as a block driver in
the guest and talks to an appropriate device driver on the host, communicating over
the vmbus. In this respect, it is identical to block drivers we have for guests in other
virtualization platforms (Xen etc.). The only difference is that on the host side,
the only way you can assign a scsi disk to the guest is to configure this scsi disk
under the scsi controller. So, while blkvsc is a generic block driver, because of the
restrictions on the host side, it only ends up managing block devices that have IDE majors.

As I noted earlier, it is incorrect to view Hyper-V blkvsc driver as an IDE driver. There
is nothing IDE specific about it. It is very much like other block front-end drivers
(like in Xen) that get their device information from the host and register the block
device accordingly with the guest. It just happens that in the current version of the
Windows host, only devices that are configured as IDE devices in the host end up being
managed by this driver. To make this clear, in my recent cleanup of this driver (these patches
have been applied), all IDE major information has been properly consolidated.
