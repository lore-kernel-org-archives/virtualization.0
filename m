It was working, and I expect to have it working again.  It is not in 
development, but we urgently need to find a way to fix the problems 
created when Ingo hobbled it by removing NO_IDLE_HZ code from 2.6.21..

Anything that attempts to create this uber multi-virtual interrupt / 
timer / IPI / clock management beast is going to add a huge number of 
paravirt hooks, because the vendor backends will be different for all of 
these.

You mean why we need them?  They make APIC writes faster, since 
otherwise they would trap and emulate, which is slow, and APIC is on 
critical paths.  Or why people object to them?  I don't get the latter 
either.

We have that working fine.  It is getting the clock event to work 
independently from the lapic timer that is difficult because of the i386 
backend.

But we enable and use them, in both full-virt, and paravirt mode.  So we 
really would need to duplicate the code, almost exactly for our "virtual 
interrupt controller", which would really just be a wrapper on top of a 
nearly identical APIC or IO-APIC implementation.

Yes, but we would then need to duplicate the APIC or IO-APIC 
implementation, because that is the hardware we emulate and use.  We 
just want a different way to fire local timers, that is all.

Yes, we could do a cleaner simpler version.  But then we need to write 
this new interrupt controller code for both the hypervisor and for 
Linux.  And the fact that it is cleaner doesn't make it any nicer or 
perform any better - it is just another dependency between the kernel 
and hypervisor that then becomes hard to change.  So we would rather 
stay as close to the hardware design as possible.

We have (2) working.  But Thomas apparently hated it.  The idea I have 
about a single-IRQ source interrupt controller for timers seems pretty 
nice, and does almost exactly encapsulate the one difference we have 
from standard APIC / IO-APIC hardware - a different way to drive local 
timers.

Thanks for your feedback,
