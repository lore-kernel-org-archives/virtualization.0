Yep, hpa too raised the same issue, I spoke to him during LPC and we
decided that 2.6.37 will be the right time frame for removal of this
code. 
For now I have just added some text in the feature-removal file and
disabled VMI by default in the Kconfig, the reason that needs to be done
is because "Live Migration" of a VMI enabled VM to future products which
don't support VMI will not work, so its important that newer distros
keep this disabled, if they want seamless migration that is.

Okay, have added that text too.

Thanks for your comments.

Ingo/hpa, please consider the patch below for tip.

Mark VMI for deprecation in feature-removal-schedule.txt.

From: Alok N Kataria <akataria@vmware.com>

Add text in feature-removal.txt and also modify Kconfig to disable
vmi by default.

+What:	Support for VMware's guest paravirtuliazation technique [VMI] will be
+	dropped.
+When:	2.6.37 or earlier.
+Why:	With the recent innovations in CPU hardware acceleration technologies
+	from Intel and AMD, VMware ran a few experiments to compare these
+	techniques to guest paravirtualization technique on VMware's platform.
+	These hardware assisted virtualization techniques have outperformed the
+	performance benefits provided by VMI in most of the workloads. VMware
+	expects that these hardware features will be ubiquitous in a couple of
+	years, as a result, VMware has started a phased retirement of this
+	feature from the hypervisor. We will be removing this feature from the
+	Kernel too. Right now we are targeting 2.6.37 but can retire earlier if
+	technical reasons ( read opportunity to remove major chunk of pvops)
+	arise.
+
+	Please note that VMI has always been an optimization and non-VMI kernels
+	still work fine on VMware's platform.
+	Latest versions of VMware's product which support VMI are,
+	Workstation 7.0 and VSphere 4.0 on ESX side, future maintainence
