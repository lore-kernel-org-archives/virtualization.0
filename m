1) Example code: old libc headers don't have SIOCBRADDIF, and old zlibs
   don't have gzdirect() -- it's a sanity check anyway.
2) Some people don't build in their source directories, so .config
   isn't there (thanks to Tony Breeds <tony@bakeyournoodle.com>).
3) Point out that guest and host kernel are usually the same.
4) Set the "no checksum" option on the tun device as a minor optimization.
