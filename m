If we keep track of cgroup information in bio and don't loose it while
bio traverses through the stack of devices, then leaf node can still do
the proportional fair share allocation among contending cgroups on that
device.

I think end users care about getting fair share if there is a contention
anywhere along the IO path. Real contention is at leaf nodes. However =

complex the logical device topology is, if two applications are not
contending for disk at lowest level, there is no point in doing any kind
of resource management among them. Though the applications seemingly might
be contending for higher level logical device, at leaf nodes, their IOs
might be going to different disk altogether and practically there is no
contention. =

Are there some devices which don't use elevators at leaf nodes? If no,
then its not a issue. =

I am not able to understand why some kind of topology information needs
to be passed to underlying elevators. As long as end device can map a bio
correctly to the right cgroup (irrespective of complex topology) and end
device step into resource management only if there is contention for
resources among cgroups on that device, things are fine. We don't have
to worry about intermediate complex topology.

I will take one hypothetical example. Lets assume there are two cgroups
A and B with weights 2048 and 1024 respectively. To me this information
means that if A, and B really conted for the resources somewhere, then
make sure A gets 2/3 of resources and B gets 1/3 of resource.

Now if tasks in these two groups happen to contend for same disk at lowest
level, we do resource management otherwise we don't. Why do I need to
worry about intermediate logical devices in the IO path? =


May be I am missing something. A detailed example will help here...  =

True. So are we saying that a user can get expected CFQ or AS behavior
only if there is no contention. If there is contention, then we don't
gurantee anything?

The goal here is not to increase throughput by doing buffering at higher
layer. This is what IO scheduler currently does. It tries to buffer bios
and select these appropriately to boost throughput. If one needs to focus
on increasing throughput, it should be done at IO scheduler level and
not by introducing one more buffering layer in between.

It is not a show stopper for sure. But it can be a genuine concern in case
of CFQ atleast which tries to provide fairness among tasks.

Think of following scenario. (Diagram taken from peterz's mail).
		root
		/ | \
	       1  2  A
		    / \
		   B   3

Assume that task 1, task 2 and group A belong to Best effort class and they
all have the same priority. If we go for two level scheduling than, disk BW
will be divided in the ratio of 25%, 25% and 50% between task 1, task 2 and
group A.

I think it should instead be 33% each. Again coming back to the idea of
treating 1, 2 and A at same level.

So this is not a show stopper but once you go for one approach, swithing
to another will become really hard as it might require close interatction
with underlying scheduler and fundamentally 2 level scheduler will find
it very hard to communicate with IO scheduler.

IMHO, two level scheduling approach makes a case only if resource
management at leaf nodes does not solve the requirements. So far we =

have not got a concrete example where resource management at intermediate
logical devices is needed and resource management at leaf nodes is not
sufficient.  =
