Why do you care if you are the only one with a reference?

If you do, then just don't grab that reference and do the work in the
cleanup callback :)

No one reads documentation :(

This doesn't make sense, nor does it sound like a use for a kref (or you
are using it wrong.)

Then don't do that.

Then just cleanup when it hits 0, like the rest of the world does.

No, no one reads documentation, sorry.  Either fix your use of kref
(i.e. don't care about the count), or do something else, as you don't
want a kref, but rather, an atomic count of what is going on and "1"
means something "special" to you.

sorry,
