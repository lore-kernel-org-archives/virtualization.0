Insulting again.  Wow.

It took me this long to understand your complaint.  Perhaps I'm stupid.
Or perhaps you are terrible at explaining yourself, and it is only
through our patient and heroic efforts that we can comprehend you at
all?

Actually, it depends on NET_VENDOR_INTEL which depends on CONFIG_PCI,
but yes, it's discoverable.

So your actual complaint is that:
1) CONFIG_VIRTIO is misleadingly documented both in comment and name.
2) It's not discoverable, since it's only selected via other things.

As grep would show you, it's selected by LGUEST, S390_GUEST, RPMSG,
VIRTIO_PCI and VIRTIO_MMIO (VIRTIO_BALLOON is a cut & paste bug, already
patched by MST).

We could change every virtio device to depend on (CONFIG_LGUEST |
CONFIG_S390_GUEST | CONFIG_RPMSG | CONFIG_VIRTIO_PCI |
CONFIG_VIRTIO_MMIO), which is more discoverable but uglier.  How's this
workaround?

Subject: virtio: add help to CONFIG_VIRTIO option.

Trying to enable a virtio driver (eg CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK) is painful
because it depends on CONFIG_VIRTIO.  CONFIG_VIRTIO doesn't tell you
how to turn it on (it's selected from anything which provides a virtio
bus).

This patch at least adds some documentation, visible in menuconfig, as
a hint.
