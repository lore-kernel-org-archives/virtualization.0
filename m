That is what I have currently implemented both on the stor as well
as the net side with regards to the device specific objects hanging off of
struct hv_device (the ext field). If it is ok with you, I want to do what you
had suggested earlier. Keep the patches as they are with regards to 
reference counting for now. We can always simplify the code later.
