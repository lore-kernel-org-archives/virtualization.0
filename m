Yes, and I think it was a mistake to add the hack there. This is what
prevented applications from using the new interface in the 3 years
since it was first introduced.

Nod.
One question on implementation:
why does skb_checksum_help set the checksum state to
CHECKSUM_NONE? Shouldn't it be CHECKSUM_COMPLETE?

Since using the module involves updating the management tools
as well, if we go down this route it will be much less painful
for everyone to do push it upstream.
