So bear with me, I've not really pondered this well so it could be full
of holes (again).

After the cmpxchg(&l->locked, _Q_LOCKED_VAL, _Q_SLOW_VAL) succeeds the
spin_unlock() must do the hash lookup, right? We can make the lookup
unhash.

If the cmpxchg() fails the unlock will not do the lookup and we must
unhash.
