The upgrade path from hv_blkvsc to hv_storvsc is difficult.

hv_storvsc does not provide the vmbus:hv_block modalias, so mkinitrd
does not know what module to choose when mkinitrd is called in a
previous kernel (like sles11sp1).


In a guest with both SCSI and IDE controllers the IDE disks are
discovered first, so the SCSI drives will also change their names.
Thats not a problem for data partitions because they could be mounted by
UUID or LABEL in fstab.
But its difficult to adjust /boot/grub/device.map for example because
the old  IDE drives do not provide an identifier. What is the best way
to make sure the rename from hd* to sd* in such config files is done
correctly? Is it safe to assume that all drives with a class_id of
32412632-86cb-44a2-9b5c50d1417354f5 are connected to IDE ports?

localhost:~ # head /sys/bus/vmbus/devices/vmbus_0_{1,2,3,10,11}/class_id

In my test system, the IDE drives are now discovered twice, once by
hv_storvsc and once by libata:
