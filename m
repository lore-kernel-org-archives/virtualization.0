Group all the "guest OS" support options together, under
CONFIG_PARAVIRT.  Make this a proper menu item so it looks neater on
menuconfig etc, and make the wording for each prompt uniform.

 	  Paravirtualization is a way of running multiple instances of

 	  changes the kernel so it can modify itself when it is run

 	  However, when run without a hypervisor the kernel is
 	  theoretically slower.  If in doubt, say N.
