I guess, but this seems simpler.  It could be removed altogether, but it
would be nice to make sure it never happens.

xen-head.S jumps back to startup_paravirt.  That could be exported, and
then it could be linked separately.  There used to be a requirement that
the code in xen-head.S be at a compile-time known address, but that's no
longer the case.

I got complaints about section attribute mismatches without it.

This is a big rollup patch of all the core Xen stuff; the subject is
wrong.  But I added this for Xen because it needs to make sure the page
is all zero and doesn't have some left-over pieces of old pagetable.

Erm, not sure.  The write needs to be complete before the read happens. 
Which is the right barrier for that?

Yeah.  Are there any existing definitions of the x86 gate types?

It's a local per-cpu cache of the idt as set by the kernel.  Xen doesn't
use the idt directly, but it remembers what idt has been set so it can
tell if an idt descriptor update is affecting the current idt or
something else.  Its a bit over-engineered, since the idt isn't really
touched much at all.

Delete.  Don't really need it any more.

Under Xen, an early BUG gets a nice register dump and backtrack from the
hypervisor, so its pretty useful for debugging.

Yeah, or even just a simple structure, since the elements are
short/byte/byte.

Hm, it was.  Seems completely redundant.

Xen doesn't support preempt.

I need to test this a bit.  This is here because set_64bit doesn't work
properly under qemu (its emulation mis-reports the eip if the
instruction faults), but I haven't tested this under native.

The PDA structure contains some Xen-specific (or generally, paravirt
backend specific) parts, which need initialization when the rest of the
PDA is.
