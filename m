Hi. This patchset implements ia64/pv_ops support which is the
framework for virtualization support.
Changes from take 5 are rebased to Linux 2.6.26-rc3,
bug fix ivt.S paravirtualization and multi entry point support.
I believe these patches can be applied to the linux ia64 repository.

On x86 various ways to support virtualization were proposed, and
eventually pv_ops won. So on ia64 the pv_ops strategy is appropriate too.
Later I'll post the patchset which implements xen domU based on
ia64/pv_ops. Currently only ia64/xen pv_ops implementation exists,
but I believe ia64/kvm can also obtain benefits from this ia64/pv_ops
frame work.
linux/ia64 has the machine vector interface and another approach might be
to utilize it. However pv_ops is better for some reasons. Please see
the thread of the mailing list from
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ia64/msg05238.html


This patchset does the followings.
- some preparation work. Mainly make the kernel virtualization friendly.
- introduce multi entry point support.
- introduce pv_info which describes the execution environment.
- introduce macros for hand written assembly code to paravirtualize
  hand written code to replace sensitive/privileged instructions.
- introduce various hooks to replace the implementation with
  paravirtualized.
  They are defined as function tables called, pv_init_ops, pv_cpu_ops,
  pv_irq_ops, pv_iosapic_ops and, pv_time_ops.
  They represent
    pv_init_ops: hooks for various initialization.
    pv_cpu_ops: hooks for ia64 intrinsics.
    pv_irq_ops: hooks for irq related operations.
    pv_iosapic_ops: hooks for paravirtualized iosapic.
    pv_time_ops: hooks for steal time accounting

branch: xen-ia64-2008may19

At this phase, we don't address the following issues.
Those will be addressed after the first merge.
- optimization by binary patch
  In fact, we had the patch to do that, but we intentionally dropped
  for patch size/readability/cleanness.
- freeing the unused pages, i.e. pages for unused ivt.S.

Changes from take 5:
- rebased to Linux 2.6.26-rc3
- fix ivt.S paravirtualization.
  One instruction was wrongly paravirtualized.
  It wasn't revealed with Xen HVM domain so far, but with real hw
- multi entry point support.
- revised changelog to add CCs.

Changes from take 4:
- refined NR_IRQS paravirtualization according to Jes Soresen's comment
- rebased and fixed the breakage due to the upstream change.
- fixed various compilation errors.

Changes from take 3:
- split the patch set into pv_op part and xen domU part.
- many clean ups.
- introduced pv_ops: pv_cpu_ops and pv_time_ops.

Changes from take 2:
- many clean ups following to comments.
- clean up:assembly instruction macro.
- introduced pv_ops: pv_info, pv_init_ops, pv_iosapic_ops, pv_irq_ops.

Changes from take 1:
Single IVT source code. compile multitimes using assembler macros.

thanks,
