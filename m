Does it matter how long interrupts are actually disabled.  Tickless is 
definitely the preferred mode of operation for any virtual guest, so 
time accounting is independent from when the actual timer interrupts 
occur; its quite possible we'll see no interrupts for a long time 
indeed.  If we accrue unstolen time to a task when we actually context 
switch then the accounting will all work out, no?

Yes, Xen already accounts stolen time in its timer interrupt handler.

But more significantly it uses unstolen time as the timebase for 
sched_clock() so that the scheduler will only credit a task for the 
actual amount of time it spends executing, rather than a full wallclock 
timeslice.

No, I'm not advocating anything in particular; I'm trying to understand 
your proposal.

You're positing two timebases: one which measures wallclock time (that 
could be the tsc in VMWare's case), and another which measures unstolen 
time, so you can tell how long a cpu has spent actually running 
something.  What's your proposal for the unstolen clock?  How does the 
kernel measure unstolen time?  It can't measure it with the tsc, because 
that would include any stolen time in the measurement.

Also, I'm not sure it makes sense to distinguish between vcpu idle time 
and stolen time.  If a vcpu is idle/blocked, how can you steal time from 
it?  It's only stolen time if it wants to run but can't.

Yes, Xen exposes all the necessary accounting information directly.  It 
also guarantees that if you add up blocked+runnable+running+offline == 
wallclock time.

See xen/time.c: do_stolen_accounting(), and how it accumulates stolen 
time with account_steal_ticks().
