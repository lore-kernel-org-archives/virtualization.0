Thanks for the context. This issue is very similar to the one that used to
exist when running out of transmit descriptors, before the removal of
the timer and introduction of skb_orphan in start_xmit.

To make sure that I understand correctly, let me paraphrase:

A. guest socket cannot send because it exhausted its sk budget (sndbuf, tsq, ..)

B. budget is not freed up until guest receives tx completion for this flow

C. tx completion is held back on the host side in vhost_zerocopy_signal_used
   behind the completion for an unrelated skb

D. unrelated packet is delayed somewhere in the host stackf zerocopy
completions.
   e.g., netem

The issue that is specific to vhost-net zerocopy is that (C) enforces strict
ordering of transmit completions causing head of line blocking behind
vhost-net zerocopy callbacks.

This is a different problem from

C1. tx completion is delayed until guest sends another packet and
       triggers free_old_xmit_skb

Both in host and guest, zerocopy packets should never be able to loop
to a receive path where they can cause unbounded delay.

The obvious cases of latency are queueing, like netem. That leads
to poor performance for unrelated flows, but I don't see how this
could cause deadlock.
