Yes. I tried this before we went ahead with per-interface vhost 
threading model.
At that time, per-cpu vhost  showed a regression with a single-VM and
per-vq vhost showed good performance improvements upto 8 VMs.

So  just making it per-cpu would not be enough. I think we may need a way
to schedule vcpu threads on the same cpu-socket as vhost.

Another aspect we need to look into is the splitting of vhost thread 
into separate
threads for TX and RX. Shirley is doing some work in this area and she 
is seeing
perf. improvements as long as TX and RX threads are on the same cpu-socket.

But this may not be scalable long term when we want to support a large 
number of VMs each
having multiple virtio-net interfaces with multiple queues.
