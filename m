The reverse actually, right?

Right, we want a new API that advances event index but does not
set VRING_AVAIL_F_NO_INTERRUPT.
IMO still want to set VRING_AVAIL_F_NO_INTERRUPT when handling tx
interrupts, to avoid interrupt storms.

Yes but we are asking for an interrupt before event index is reached
because something is waiting for the packet to be transmitted.
I couldn't come up with a better name.
