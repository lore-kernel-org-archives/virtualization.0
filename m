Hi,

I believe this work is very important especially in the context of 
virtual machines.  I think it would be more useful though implemented in 
the context of the IO scheduler.  Since we already support a notion of 
IO priority, it seems reasonable to add a notion of an IO cap.

Regards,

Anthony Liguori
